010 is the tenth album from Japanese Punk Techno band <Org>The Mad Capsule Markets</Org> . 
This album proved to be more commercial and more techno-based than Osc-Dis , with heavily synthesized songs like Introduction 010 and Come . 
Founding member <Person>Kojima Minoru</Person> played guitar on Good Day , and Wardanceis cover of a song by <Location>UK</Location> post punk industrial band <Org>Killing Joke</Org> . 
XXX can of This had a different meaning , and most people did n't understand what the song was about . 
it was later explained that the song was about Cannabis ( ' can of this ' sounding like Cannabis when said faster ) it is uncertain if they were told to change the lyric like they did on P.O.P and HUMANITY . 
<Location>UK</Location> Edition came with the OSC-DIS video , and most of the tracks were re-engineered . 
The <Org>139th</Org> was formed at <Location>Camp Howe</Location> , near <Location>Pittsburgh</Location> , on September 1 , 1862 . 
<Person>Frederick H. Collier</Person> was the first colonel . 
After burying the dead on the field of Second Battle of Bull Run , the regiment was attached to <Org>Howe 's Brigade</Org> of <Org>Couch 's Division</Org> of the <Org>IV Corps</Org> of the <Org>Army of the Potomac</Org> where it replaced <Org>De Trobriand 's 55th New York</Org> , <Org>Gardes Lafayette</Org> regiment on September 11 , 1862 . 
The composition of this brigade remained unchanged from this point until the war 's end and included the <Org>62d NY</Org> , <Org>93d PVI</Org> , <Org>98th PVI</Org> and the <Org>102d PVI</Org> . 
During this time <Org>Couch 's Division</Org> was detached from the <Org>Army</Org> and was occupied with guarding the fords on the <Location>Potomac</Location> . 
The <Org>139th</Org> along with its brigade and division spent the next week marching from <Location>Poolesville</Location> to <Location>Sandy Hook</Location> , <Location>Maryland</Location> from where on September 17 , 1862 , it was forced marched to the Battle of Antietam where it was placed in line of battle but did not see any significant combat . 
The next day , the regiment pursued the <Org>Confederate</Org> army and fought in a skirmish at <Location>Williamsport</Location> . 
The <Org>139th</Org> was transferred in October 1862 to the <Org>VI Corps</Org> . 
In the Battle of Fredericksburg , it suffered minor casualties from artillery fire , but did n't get a chance to fight . 
Five months later , however , it did participate in the 2nd Battle of Fredericksburg . 
At the Battle of Gettysburg in July , it helped defend the left flank of the <Org>Union</Org> army . 
Throughout the spring and into early summer of 1864 , the <Org>139th</Org> fought in Grant 's Overland Campaign and the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg . 
In July , it was transferred to <Location>Washington , D.C.</Location> with the rest of the <Org>VI Corps</Org> to defeat <Person>Lt. Gen. Jubal Early</Person> 's attack on the city . 
Then they fought under <Person>Philip Sheridan</Person> in the <Location>Valley</Location> to ensure that no more <Org>Confederate</Org> armies would invade again . 
( See the article on the campaign ) . 
By December 1864 , they were back in the siege lines of <Location>Petersburg</Location> . 
The <Org>139th</Org> supported <Person>Sheridan</Person> in the Appomattox Campaign and fought in the Battle of Sayler 's Creek . 
After the surrender at <Location>Appomattox Courthouse</Location> , it was ordered to the <Location>North Carolina</Location> border to support <Person>William T. Sherman</Person> , but the <Org>Confederate</Org> surrender there made further support unnecessary . 
The regiment was mustered out June 21 , 1865 . 
The 1896 <Location>Atlantic City</Location> rail crash occurred shortly after 6:30 pm on July 30 , 1896 at a crossing just west of <Location>Atlantic City</Location> , <Location>New Jersey</Location> , crushing five loaded passenger coaches , killing 50 and seriously injuring approximately 60 . 
A train consisting of seven cars left <Location>Atlantic City</Location> over the <Location>West Jersey Railroad</Location> bearing a special excursion of Red Men and their friends from <Location>Bridgeton</Location> and <Location>Salem</Location> , <Location>New Jersey</Location> , and had reached the crossing of the <Location>Reading Railroad</Location> when it was struck by the 5:40 down express train from <Location>Philadelphia</Location> . 
Two cars were demolished and the two following cars were telescoped . 
The engine of the <Location>Reading</Location> train was wrecked , the engineer killed , and the fireman fatally injured . 
The car behind it was thrown from the track and many of its occupants were killed or injured . 
In 1896 , leaving <Location>Atlantic City</Location> , the tracks of the <Location>West Jersey Road</Location> ran parallel to those of the <Location>Camden</Location> and <Location>Atlantic</Location> until they crossed the drawbridge , when they switched off to the south , crossing the <Location>Reading Road</Location> at an oblique angle . 
<Person>John Greiner</Person> , the engineer of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train , saw the <Location>Reading</Location> train approaching the crossing at a swift speed , but as the signals were open for him to proceed on his way , he continued . 
His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the <Location>Reading</Location> train , which left <Location>Philadelphia</Location> at 5:40 pm , struck the first car full in the centre , throwing it far off the track in a nearby ditch , and completely submerging it . 
The second car of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train was also carried into the ditch , the third and fourth cars being telescoped . 
The engine of the <Location>Reading</Location> train was thrown to the other side of the track , carrying with it the first coach . 
A few minutes after the collision , the boiler of the <Location>Reading</Location> locomotive exploded , scalding several to death and casting boiling spray over many of the injured passengers . 
As soon as the news reached <Location>Atlantic City</Location> it spread rapidly , and thousands of people flocked to the scene . 
The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages , omnibuses , bicycles , and all kinds of vehicles , while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to render what assistance they could or to satisfy their curiosity . 
Darkness fell quickly , and the work of rescuing the injured and recovering the bodies of the dead was carried out under the glare of huge bonfires . 
As onlookers watched through the night , the mangled and burned bodies of the dead were carried from the wreckage which trapped them and laid side by side on the gravel bank near the track , with no other covering than the few newspapers gathered from the passengers . 
The wounded were quickly gathered together and carried by train and wagon to the <Org>Atlantic City Hospital</Org> , where six of them died shortly after their arrival . 
Two others died within a day , with 42 having been killed at the collision scene . 
The old <Location>Excursion House</Location> at the foot of <Location>Mississippi Avenue</Location> was converted into a morgue , and the dead were taken there . 
During the first night after the crash , the streets in the vicinity of the <Location>Excursion House</Location> and the <Org>City Hospital</Org> , as well as the road leading to the scene of the accident , were packed with people anxious to learn the latest news . 
The <Location>Bridgeton</Location> and <Location>Salem</Location> excursionists who escaped injury were brought back to <Location>Atlantic City</Location> and sent home on a special train several hours later in the evening . 
<Person>James W. Hoyt</Person> , Secretary of the <Org>New Jersey Department of Public Safety</Org> , immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident , telegraphed for the <Org>Philadelphia Medical Emergency Corps</Org> , fifteen of whom responded , and hurried to <Location>Atlantic City</Location> on a special train which left <Location>Philadelphia</Location> at 10:45 pm . 
These surgeons materially aided <Location>Atlantic City</Location> 's volunteer corps , which was composed of almost every physician then living in the city . 
Many of the injured were taken to hotels , as the city hospitals soon became overcrowded . 
About thirty of the wounded had their injuries dressed and were able to proceed on their way . 
The wife of <Person>Edward Farr</Person> , the <Location>Reading</Location> engineer who died while on the job , and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake , when informed of the accident and of her husband 's death , was unable to withstand the shock , and fell to the floor dead . 
County Coroner <Person>William McLaughlin</Person> , immediately upon hearing of the accident , went to the scene . 
He went directly into the block tower and questioned operator <Person>George F. Hauser. Houser</Person> told him that he thought the excursion train had time to cross the tracks of the <Location>Reading</Location> before the express got there and he set the " clear " signal for the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train . 
( The signalling system worked as follows : the interlocking block system was used . 
There were three poles with semaphores controlled by the tower on the reading tracks and two on the <Location>West Jersey</Location> . 
The pole furthest from the tower on the <Location>Reading</Location> tracks was distant about 2,000 yards . 
The other two were much closer . 
When the operator set the " clear " signal on the <Location>Pennsylvania</Location> track , this would automatically set the " danger " signal on the <Location>Reading</Location> track , and vice versa . ) 
Before <Person>Hauser</Person> could make a further explanation to the coroner he received an order from the railroad officials to say nothing . 
He obeyed , and made no further explanation . 
Pending an investigation , <Person>Hauser</Person> was put under arrest by the coroner , but was released on $500 bond . 
A jury was impanelled the following day . 
Testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead <Location>Reading Railroad</Location> express engineer , <Person>Edward Farr</Person> . 
His action in running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour past a danger signal seemed inexplicable to those present at the inquest . 
His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of exceptionally high moral character , and not of a reckless or careless disposition . 
Only two weeks previous to the accident his train was signalled to stop at that very crossing , and he promptly brought his train under control . 
The coroner 's jury returned verdicts on August 7 . 
Six jurors merely stated the manner of the passengers ' deaths . 
Three found that " Engineer <Person>Edward D</Person> . 
<Person>Farr</Person> of the <Location>Atlantic City Railroad</Location> failed for have his engine under proper control on approaching [ the ] crossing , and that Tower Man <Person>George F. Hauser</Person> , in giving the excursion train of the <Location>West Jersey Railroad</Location> the right of way over a fast express used bad judgment. .. [ and ] that Engineer <Person>John Greiner</Person> of said excursion train erred in not exercising greater care on crossing ahead of said fast express . " 
Three others found that " the cause of the collision was the failure of <Person>Edward Farr</Person> , engineer of Train No. 23 , to give heed in time to the semaphore signals and crossing under the rules. .. the tower man , <Person>George F. Hauser</Person> , may have used poor judgment in his estimate of the distance away of the <Location>Atlantic City Railroad</Location> train when he gave the white boards to the <Location>West Jersey</Location> and <Location>Seashore</Location> Excursion Train No . 700 .

<Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> ( or <Org>Thirty Seconds to Mars</Org> ) is an alternative rock band from <Location>Los Angeles</Location> , <Location>California</Location> , featuring <Person>Jared Leto</Person> , <Person>Shannon Leto</Person> , <Person>Tomo Milicevic</Person> . 
Created in 1998 by <Person>Jared Leto</Person> and his brother , <Person>Shannon</Person> , <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> began as a small family project . 
Things began to speed up quickly , and <Person>Matt Wachter</Person> later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player . 
After working with small revolving door of guitarists ( as the band 's first two guitarists , <Person>Kevin Drake</Person> and <Person>Solon Bixler</Person> , left the band due to issues primarily related to touring ) , the three auditioned <Person>Tomo MiliФeviФ</Person> to round out the band 's roster . 
According to an interview from <Org>Virgin Records</Org> , the band 's name 
<Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> ' first , self-titled album , produced by <Person>Bob Ezrin</Person> , was released in 2002 to mixed reviews and achieved sales of just over 100,000 . 
Their sophomore album , A Beautiful Lie , was released on August 30 , 2005 . 
For this effort , the band traveled ( during the course of three years ) to four continents , to perfect their sound and also to allow for <Person>Jared</Person> 's film career . 
The album was produced by <Person>Josh Abraham</Person> , whose producing credits also include <Org>Orgy</Org> , <Org>Velvet Revolver</Org> , and <Org>Linkin Park</Org> . 
Because A Beautiful Lie was leaked five months before its release , the band decided to include two bonus tracks : " Battle of One " ( an original song that was also set to be the album 's title track when it was first announced ) and " Hunter " ( a cover of the <Org>BjУЖrkband</Org> song ) . 
To further promote the album , the band also enclosed " golden tickets " in 12 copies , which granted their owners access to any <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> concert free of charge , along with backstage access .

The tour was " environmentally sound " according to a 2006 interview with then-bassist <Person>Matt Wachter</Person> . 
" <Person>Jared</Person> and <Person>Shannon</Person> put together this thing called Environmentor which is illustrating ways --- alternatives --- to kind of clean up some of the mess we leave behind . 
We fueled the bus with vegetable oil , " he explains . 
On November 20 , <Org>MTV2</Org> premiered the video for " From Yesterday " ; the video is the first American rock video ever shot in its entirety in the <Location>People 's Republic of China</Location> .

They are also scheduled to play Roskilde , Rock am Ring , Pinkpop , Give It A Name Festival and Download . 
Following other commitments , they will begin working on their third album . 
Following the release of " From Yesterday " as a single , the band posted a link on their <Org>MySpace</Org> blog to vote for the next single from A Beautiful Lie . 
The choices available were " A Beautiful Lie " , " The Fantasy " , " Savior " , and " The Story " . 
Another vote was done later between the top two songs , " A Beautiful Lie " and " The Fantasy " . 
On May 2 , 2007 , the band announced that " A Beautiful Lie " had won and would be the next single . 
On August 8th , 2007 , <Org>Kerrang !</Org> announced that <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> has been nominated for two categories of the <Org>Kerrang !</Org> 
Awards 2007 - Best International Newcomer and Best Single - The Kill . 
On August 24th , they had only won the award for ' Best Single , ' which was The Kill . 
The other award was lost to <Org>Madina Lake</Org> . 
On November 1 , 2007 , the band won the MTV Europe Music Award for " Rock Out " , one of the two catorgories they were nominated in . 
On December 21st , 2007 , <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> won <Org>Fuse</Org> 's Best of 2007 Award . 
They beat out <Org>Korn</Org> and had amassed over 7 million votes . 
31 other bands and artists such as <Person>Justin Timberlake</Person> , <Person>Gwen Stefani</Person> , <Org>Linkin Park</Org> and <Org>Avenged Sevenfold</Org> were also included in the contest . 
The band 's phoenix logo ( which the band named " Mithra " ) bears the phrase " Provehito in Altum " , the band 's motto . 
Roughly translated from Latin , this means " Launch forth into the deep " ; but a more stylized version would be " Rocket in ( to ) High ( ness ) " . 
The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band 's debut , whereas for A Beautiful Lie , the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls , along with the band 's name and motto . 
The <Org>Echelon</Org> is a publicity street team for the band <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> , which helps in bringing friends to the shows , phoning local radio stations to request the band 's songs , putting up posters , posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online , and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band . 
It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars . 
The band made acoustic versions of songs from their second album A Beautiful Lie . 
Some of the acoustics have been included in some versions of the album , e.g. Was it a Dream ? ( Acoustic ) . 
In addition to the tracks on their two full-length releases thus far , the band has also recorded a few other tracks . 
Among these tracks are " Phase 1 : Fortification " and " Valhalla " , the latter of which was present on an early demo . 
" Phase 1 : Fortification " was released on an overseas single for " Capricorn ( A Brand New Name ) " . 
Another track featured on certain imported <Org>30 Seconds to Mars</Org> titles is " Anarchy in Tokyo " , a song that was recorded during the process of their self-titled debut . 
" Revolution " was also recorded for the self-titled album , but was n't included because it did n't fit the theme of the album , and because of fear that listeners would take the lyrics too literally , especially after the September 11 , 2001 attacks . 
" Occam 's Razor " was also recorded , but was never included on any of the band 's releases . 
As a result , it is considered the most difficult to locate of the five unreleased tracks . 
Demo versions of songs on the band 's self-titled debut were also slightly different , along with different names . 
For example , " Fallen " was previously called " Jupiter " , and " Year Zero " was previously called " Hero " . 
Also made available are the demo versions of " Buddha for Mary " and " 93 Million Miles " ; the latter originally had lyrics referring to the band <Org>Deadsy</Org> , whose members <Person>Dr. Nner</Person> and <Person>P. Exeter Blue I</Person> provided extra instrumentation on several tracks , but the lyrics were changed after the two bands were involved in a small feud . 
During recent live shows , the band has premiered two new songs , one of which may end up on the new album : " Some Other Son " and " The Believer " , which were initially written for the self-titled album but was scrapped during recording , as well as live songs such as " Sisters of Heresy " and " Under Pressure / Pressure " ( Name of song unsure , name based on lyrics ) . 
They also have a song called " Time to Wake Up . " 
On December 11 , 2006 , the band sent their fans a " stocking stuffer " in the form of a holiday song called " Santa Through the Back Door " . 
In September 2007 , the band also recorded a cover of <Person>Kanye West</Person> 's " Stronger " for <Org>BBC Radio 1</Org> 's Live Lounge .

<Org>6PR</Org> , known as <Org>882 6PR</Org> , commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 
<Org>6PR</Org> 's focus is on news , talk and sport , and is <Location>Perth</Location> 's only commercial talkback radio station . 
<Org>6PR</Org> is owned by <Org>Fairfax Media</Org> , an Australian media company that owns television and radio businesses throughout <Location>Australia</Location> . 
Radio in <Location>Australia</Location> was just twelve years old when <Org>6PR</Org> commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 
<Org>6PR</Org> was founded by electrical company <Org>Nicholson 's Limited</Org> , which ran the station from a studio above its showroom in <Location>Barrack Street</Location> , <Location>Perth</Location> . 
In 1963 the <Org>Victorian Broadcasting Network</Org> purchased <Org>Nicholson 's</Org> and sold the electrical division of the organisation to <Org>Vox Adeon</Org> . 
The broadcasting business was retained and operated under the name <Org>Nicholson 's Broadcasting Service Pty Ltd</Org> . 
The operation moved from <Location>Barrack Street</Location> to 340 <Location>Hay Street</Location> just after the purchase by the <Org>VBN</Org> in 1963 . 
The <Org>6PR</Org> studio remained at 340 <Location>Hay Street</Location> for 22 years before it was demolished to make way for the expansion of <Org>Mercedes College</Org> . 
In 1985 the station relocated to its current premises at 169 <Location>Hay Street</Location> , <Location>East Perth</Location> . 
In the station 's early days there were only four people on the payroll now there are around one hundred . 
The limited hours of broadcasting 69 years ago have gradually been increased to a 24 hour , seven day a week service . 
Throughout the sixties <Org>6PR</Org> was consistently the top rating station in <Location>Perth</Location> but lost its dominance in 1972 . 
The image of the station changed from rock n roll to beautiful music with the " Gentle On Your Mind " promotion in 1973 . 
This boosted <Org>6PR</Org> 's ratings to a consistent number two with a number one position on several occasions . 
In 1977 an agreement was made with the <Org>TAB</Org> by the station 's owners to broadcast races in conjunction with a personality / sport format . 
In the early eighties the station commenced a more comprehensive news and current affairs format with the introduction of regular programs by <Person>Howard Sattler</Person> , <Person>Bob Maumill</Person> and <Person>Graham Mabury</Person> , which proved extremely popular with listeners . 
In 1987 the <Org>TAB</Org> purchased <Org>6PR</Org> to secure the future of race broadcasts in <Location>Western Australia</Location> and races were broadcast across the station during popular talkback programs . 
During the early nineties the station 's current affairs / talkback program hosted by <Person>Sattler</Person> , <Person>Maumill</Person> , <Person>Mabury</Person> , <Person>Peter Newman</Person> , <Person>Gary Carvolth</Person> and <Person>Rob Broadfield</Person> achieved considerable success in spite of the ever increasing level of racing broadcasts on the station . 
In 1994 <Org>6PR</Org> , in conjunction with the <Org>TAB</Org> , was able to secure a special narrowcast broadcast license which allowed racing broadcasts to be moved from <Org>6PR</Org> to the narrowcast broadcaster called <Org>Racing Radio</Org> . 
This move allowed <Org>6PR</Org> to serve its two distinct audiences , those who listened purely for a talkback / news / current affairs format and those who listened just for racing information , in a more comprehensive manner . 
In December 1994 <Org>6PR</Org> was purchased by its current owner <Org>Southern Cross Broadcasting</Org> which also owned <Location>Melbourne</Location> 's number one rating talk station <Org>3AW</Org> and television stations in <Location>Adelaide</Location> , <Location>Canberra</Location> and other places . 
During the nineties <Org>6PR</Org> continued its dominance in the talk format arena with personalities such as <Person>David Christison</Person> & <Person>Lee Tate</Person> , <Person>Howard Sattler</Person> , <Person>Jenny Seaton</Person> & <Person>Gary Carvolth</Person> , <Person>Liam Bartlett</Person> , <Person>Harvey Deegan</Person> and <Person>Graham Mabury</Person> .

Agotes or Cagots were a discriminated minority in the <Location>Navarrese Pyrenees</Location> , <Location>Basque provinces</Location> , <Location>Bearn</Location> , <Location>Gascony</Location> and also <Location>Brittany</Location> . 
They have been also known by other names : Cagots , Gahets , Gafets in <Location>France</Location> ; Agotes , Gafos in <Location>Spain</Location> ; and Cacons , Cahets , Caqueux and Caquins in <Location>Brittany</Location> . 
The earliest mention of them is in 1288 , when they appear to have been called Christiens or Christianos . 
During the Middle Ages they were popularly looked upon as cretins , lepers , heretics and even as cannibals . 
They were shunned and hated ; were allotted separate quarters in towns , called cagoteries , and lived in wretched huts in the country distinct from the villages . 
Excluded from all political and social rights , they were only allowed to enter a church by a special door , and during the service a rail separated them from the other worshippers . 
Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament , or the Eucharist was handed to them on the end of a stick , while a receptacle for holy water was reserved for their exclusive use . 
They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress , to which , in some places , was attached the foot of a goose or duck ( whence they were sometimes called Canards ) . 
And so pestilential was their touch considered that it was a crime for them to walk the common road barefooted . 
The only trades allowed them were those of butcher and carpenter , and their ordinary occupation was wood-cutting . 
The origin of Agotes ( or Cagots ) is uncertain . 
It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths , and somebody derives the name from caas ( dog ) and Goth . 
But opposed to this etymology is the fact that the word " cagot " is first found in this form no earlier than 1551 . 
French historian <Person>Pierre de Marca</Person> ( 16th century ) , in his Histoire de Beam , holds that the word signifies hunters of the Goths , and that the Cagots are descendants of the Saracens . 
Others made them descendants of the Albigenses . 
A far more probable explanation of their name Christians is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as pauperes Christi , and that , Goths or not , these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it . 
Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins . 
It was not until the French Revolution that any steps were taken to ameliorate their lot , but today they no longer form a class and have been practically lost sight of in the general peasantry .

The <Org>Amateur Hockey Association of Canada</Org> ( <Org>AHAC</Org> ) was an amateur men 's ice hockey league founded in 1886 , in existence until 1898 . 
It was the second ice hockey league organized in <Location>Canada</Location> , after one in <Location>Kingston</Location> , <Location>Ontario</Location> started in 1883 . 
It was organized to provide a longer season to determine the Canadian champion . 
Prior to its founding the Canadian championship was determined in a tournament in <Location>Montreal</Location> . 
The 1893 champion of the league , <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> was the first winner of the Stanley Cup , being awarded the Cup as the champions of the <Org>AHAC</Org> and the <Org>AHAC</Org> was considered the top league of <Location>Canada</Location> . 
of various hockey clubs met at the <Location>Victoria Skating Rink</Location> in <Location>Montreal</Location> at the instigation of the <Org>Victoria Hockey Club</Org> of <Location>Montreal</Location> . 
They agreed that the season should run from the 1st of January until the 15th of March . 
The constitution would be adapted from a lacrosse league constitution . 
The teams knew each other . 
Mr . <Person>Thomas D</Person> . <Person>Green</Person> of <Location>Ottawa</Location> had played on the 1883 <Org>McGill</Org> hockey team . 
In that age , ice hockey was a very different game compared to today : the <Org>AHAC</Org> rules stated that there were six skaters on each side . 
The left wing , centre and right wing were the forwards , like today . 
The rover would line up behind the centre , with the point and coverpoint following , in an ' I ' formation towards the goaltender . 
The face offs were at a right angle to today 's practice , the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink . 
The goaltenders used no special equipment . 
There were no goal nets . 
The goals were two posts , with no crossbar . 
An umpire would judge the legality of each score . 
There were no boards along the sides of the ice , and there were no standard dimensions for a rink , although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink . 
A match was two halves of thirty minutes ( also to note that in the day , game meant goal by modern definition ) . 
Sudden-death overtime was also in place , and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation . 
Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes . 
The <Org>AHAC</Org> operated on two different systems in its lifetime : the challenge system , where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship , and the series system , which corresponds to the regular season found in the <Org>NHL</Org> today . 
With the exception of 1888 , the challenge system was exclusively used in the <Org>AHAC</Org> before the advent of the Stanley Cup , while the series system became the norm in 1893 , the first year the Cup was contested . 
The first championship team of the <Org>AHAC</Org> was the <Org>Montreal Crystals</Org> , having unofficially being declared the champions before the <Org>AHAC</Org> . 
The first title change occurred on January 14 , 1887 , when the <Org>Montreal Victorias</Org> defeated the champions 4-0 . 
The <Org>Victorias</Org> would hold the title until the very last challenge game , when the <Org>Crystals</Org> won 3-2 in their third successive challenge . 
Because of the <Org>Vics</Org> ' long run as champions , it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888 . 
The series system was a success , although a tie atop the standings between the <Org>Vics</Org> and the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> ( <Org>Montreal HC</Org> ) , and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two <Org>Victorias</Org> players were injured , at the home venue of the <Org>Montreal HC</Org> . 
However , teams from outside <Location>Montreal</Location> incurred huge travelling expenses , which led the <Org>AHAC</Org> to revert back to the challenge system . 
In 1893 , the first year since 1888 where the <Org>AHAC</Org> played under a series system , the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> lost their first game against the <Org>Ottawa Hockey Club</Org> , and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship . 
<Person>Lord Stanley</Person> announced that his challenge trophy ( later known simply as the Stanley Cup ) for the best amateur hockey team in <Location>Canada</Location> would be presented to the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> on May 15 , 1893 , as initial champion . 
At the time , the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> was in a dispute with its parent organization , the <Org>Montreal Amateur Athletic Association</Org> ( <Org>MAAA</Org> ) . 
The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy , while the directors of the <Org>MAAA</Org> decided to accept the trophy , considering it came from the Governor General of <Location>Canada</Location> . 
Thus , the trophy was accepted by the <Org>MAAA</Org> , but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present . 
After accepting the trophy , the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them . 
In the end , the <Org>MAAA</Org> investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy , even though such an action would damage the reputation of the <Org>MAAA</Org> . 
It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were , in fact , not representative of the team itself , and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season , it was flatly refused ( the first time the <Org>MAAA</Org> refused anything to the hockey club ) . 
Inexplicably , the hockey club reversed its position , and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the <Org>MAAA</Org> and the club . 
Indeed , the inscriptions on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated " <Org>Montreal HC</Org> " . 
The <Org>MAAA</Org> , at one point , considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them . 
The issue would be finally resolved in later years , after various attempts at reconciliation . 
Stanley Cup winner 
According to <Person>Arthur Farrell</Person> 's book of 1899 , " Hockey : Canada 's Royal Winter Game " , <Org>Montreal Crystals</Org> are recorded as champions in 1887 , and the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> is recorded as the winner from 1888-1894 . 
See reference copy on Backcheck . 
According to Ultimate Hockey , the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series . 
The final champion at the end of the season 's worth of challenges would be considered ' Dominion of Canada ' champion .

<Person>Angela Carder</Person> ( nУЉe <Person>Stone</Person> ) was an American cancer patient who , in 1987 , was forced to undergo a life-threatening Caesarean section in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her fetus . 
The case stands as a landmark in <Location>United States</Location> case law establishing the rights of pregnant women to determine their own health care . 
At age thirteen , <Person>Angela Stoner</Person> was diagnosed with a rare and usually fatal form of cancer . 
She survived , and after years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was declared to be in remission . 
Ten years after the initial diagnosis she developed another form of cancer , which she and her doctors fought with equal determination . 
The second cancer went into remission . 
<Person>Angela</Person> later married and became pregnant . 
In 1987 , when <Person>Carder</Person> was twenty-five weeks pregnant , her cancer was discovered to have recurred and metastasized to her lung . 
Exactly what plan she made on learning this is unclear : one source claims that she was determined to prolong her life , and elected to start radiation and chemotherapy , regardless of known risks to the fetus ; others state that she chose to institute only palliative care , in an effort to remain alive until the 28th week of gestation , when it was thought the fetus would have a better chance of survival . 
Whatever her choice , the administrators of <Org>George Washington University Hospital</Org> -- who were also the liability risk managers -- were disturbed to hear that she had not elected to have an immediate C-section procedure . 
Fearing a lawsuit by pro-life activists , they convened a court hearing at the hospital and obtained separate counsels for <Person>Carder</Person> , her fetus , and the hospital . 
At the hearing , family members , including <Person>Carder</Person> 's husband , opposed the C-section on the grounds that she would be unlikely to survive it and that she would not want it ( <Person>Carder</Person> herself , now gravely ill , did not testify ) . 
Her treating physicians also opposed the procedure . 
However , a neonatologist not personally familiar with her medical status testified that the fetus would have at least a 60% chance of survival -- nearly that of a healthy woman 's fetus at the same gestational age . 
<Person>Carder</Person> 's own long-term oncologist was not contacted ; he has since stated that he would have called the procedure " medically inadvisable both for <Person>Angela Carder</Person> and for the fetus " . 
Nonetheless , and despite medical testimony that such a procedure would probably end <Person>Carder</Person> 's life , an order was issued authorizing the hospital to perform an immediate C-section . 
Obstetricians at the hospital initially refused to carry out the procedure , but eventually one reluctantly agreed . 
A three-judge appellate panel upheld the decision in an emergency telephone appeal , despite <Person>Carder</Person> 's own repeated pleas of " I do n't want it done . " 
Exactly how long the fetus survived is a matter of some dispute . 
The most commonly cited figure is two hours . 
<Person>Susan Faludi</Person> quotes the obstetrician who performed the surgery as saying attempts to inflate the fetus 's lungs were " like trying to ventilate a rock " . 
<Person>Angela Carder</Person> survived her surgery by two days . 
In the wake of the surgery , <Person>Carder</Person> 's family and the <Org>American Civil Liberties Union</Org> 's <Org>Reproductive Freedom Project</Org> asked the <Org>D.C. Court of Appeals</Org> to vacate the order and its legal precedent , on grounds that the order had violated <Person>Carder</Person> 's right to informed consent and her constitutional rights of privacy and bodily integrity . 
One hundred twenty organizations filed amicus briefs on <Person>Carder</Person> 's behalf , including the <Org>American Medical Association</Org> and the <Org>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</Org> . 
One attorney for the hospital argued that it was appropriate to sacrifice a dying woman for her fetus ; an appeals court judge is reported to have replied , " Are you urging this court to find that you can handcuff a woman to a bed and force her to give birth ? " 
On April 26 , 1990 , the court issued the ruling In re A.C. , which vacated the previous decisions and ruled that <Person>Angela Carder</Person> had the right to make health-care decisions for herself and her fetus . 
At the same time as the <Org>Court of Appeals</Org> case , the <Org>ACLU</Org> and <Person>Carder</Person> 's parents , <Person>Daniel</Person> and <Person>Nettie Stoner</Person> , instituted a civil action , <Person>Stoners</Person> v. <Org>George Washington University Hospital</Org> , et al. , suing the hospital for deprivation of human rights , discrimination , wrongful death and malpractice , among other charges . 
In November of 1990 , days before the scheduled trial was to begin , the hospital settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and a promise of new hospital policies protecting the rights of pregnant women .

A Portuguesa is the national anthem of <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
It was written by <Person>Henrique Lopes de MendonУЇa</Person> ( lyrics ) and <Person>Alfredo Keil</Person> ( music ) after the nationalist resurgence provoked by the British Ultimatum ( for Portuguese troops to vacate the territory between <Location>Angola</Location> and <Location>Mozambique</Location> ) , was adopted as a <Org>Republican</Org> anthem and , finally , by the new <Location>Portuguese Republic</Location> in 1910 as the national anthem , replacing " O Hymno da Carta " , the last anthem of the <Org>Constitutional Monarchy</Org> in <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
The title A Portuguesa means " the Portuguese ( song ) " --- the Portuguese word for " song " , canУЇУЃo , being feminine --- just as La Marseillaise , the national anthem of <Location>France</Location> , is " the song of <Location>Marseille</Location> " , the Belgian anthem , The BrabanУЇonne is " the song of <Location>Brabant</Location> " , and L'Internationale , the Socialist anthem , is " the international ( song ) " . 
In 1890 , the <Location>United Kingdom</Location> issued an ultimatum demanding <Location>Portugal</Location> give up its intentions of occupying the land between the African colonies of <Location>Angola</Location> , on the western coast , and <Location>Mozambique</Location> , on the eastern coast , thus joining the two territories . 
Despite popular uproar , the government was forced to accept the British terms , a measure that contributed to the growing unpopularity of <Person>King Carlos I</Person> and the monarchy and gained supporters for the already boosting republican movement . 
Inspired by the common feeling of outrage among the people , writer <Person>Henrique Lopes de MendonУЇa</Person> composed a poem urging his compatriots to " fight for the fatherland " ( Pela PУЁtri luta ) and praising the country 's past as a naval power , particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries . 
The words were set to a melody by composer <Person>Alfredo Keil</Person> and the song soon became popular among people unhappy with what they considered a submissive and humiliating attitude by the Portuguese authorities . 
On January 31 , 1891 , a republican revolution broke out in the northern city of <Location>Porto</Location> and " A Portuguesa " was adopted by the rebels as their anthem . 
The revolution was crushed and the song banned . 
In 1910 , on October 5 , a new revolution succeeded in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic in <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
In the following year , 1911 , a law officialized the status of " A Portuguesa " as <Location>Portugal</Location> 's national anthem . 
The song consists of the first stanza from <Person>MendonУЇa</Person> 's poem followed by a chorus . 
The second and third verses below were part of the poem , but are not included in the anthem ( and are indeed unknown to even exist by a large majority of Portuguese ) . 
The fifth line of the chorus : " Contra os canhУЕes marchar , marchar " ( Against the cannons march , march ! ) is an alteration of the original " Contra os bretУЕes marchar , marchar " ( Against the Britos march , march ! ) , a reference to the Pink Map . 
Armistice Day is the anniversary of the official end of World War I , November 11 , 1918 . 
It commemorates the armistice signed between the <Org>Allies</Org> and <Location>Germany</Location> at <Location>CompiУЈgn</Location> , <Location>Franc</Location> , for the cessation of hostilities on the <Location>Western Front</Location> , which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning --- the " eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month . " 
While this official date to mark the end of the war reflects the ceasefire on the <Location>Western Front</Location> , hostilities continued in other regions , especially across the former <Location>Russian Empire</Location> and in parts of the old <Location>Ottoman Empire</Location> . 
The date was a national holiday in many of the former allied nations to allow people to commemorate those members of the armed forces who were killed during war . 
After World War II , it was changed to Veterans Day in the <Location>United States</Location> and to Remembrance Day in the <Org>British Commonwealth of Nations</Org> . 
Armistice Day is an official holiday in <Location>France</Location> . 
It is also an official holiday in <Location>Belgium</Location> , known also as the day of peace in the <Location>Flanders Fields</Location> . 
In many parts of the world , people take two minutes of silence at 11:00 in the morning as a sign of respect for the roughly eight million who died in the war , as suggested by <Person>Edward George Honey</Person> in a letter to a British newspaper though <Person>Wellesley Tudor Pole</Person> established two ceremonial periods of remembrance based on events in 1917 . 
Beginning in 1939 , the two-minute silence was moved to the Sunday nearest the 11th , in order not to interfere with wartime production should the 11th fall on a weekday . 
Since the 1990s a growing number of people have observed a two-minute silence on 11 November , resulting in both Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday being commemorated formally in the <Location>UK</Location> ( although in 2007 they fell on the same day ) . 
November 11th 2008 will be the 90th anniversary of Armistice Day .

The <Org>Australian League of Rights</Org> is a minor political organisation in <Location>Australia</Location> founded by <Person>Eric Butler</Person> with its basis in the economic theory of Social Credit expounded by <Person>C. H. Douglas</Person> . 
It describes itself as upholding the virtues of freedom . 
It is not a political party , but rather sees itself as a watchdog against government intervention . 
The <Org>League</Org> was formed in 1960 by a merger of various Leagues of Rights based in the Australian states , the first of which was based in <Location>South Australia</Location> from 1946 . 
The <Org>League</Org> 's founder <Person>Eric Butler</Person> died on June 9 2006 , at the age of 90 . 
The <Org>League</Org> , like many other far-Right organisations , strongly denies that the Holocaust , during which millions of people , particularly European Jews , were killed , ever occurred . 
It is strongly supportive of the polemicist and Holocaust denial advocate <Person>David Irving</Person> . 
They believe that the world is run by a secret society of Jews . 
The <Org>League</Org> is distinctive for asserting that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine Jewish document ( the EncyclopУІdi Britannica for example describes the Protocols as a " fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century " ) . 
The <Org>League</Org> describes itself as being based on the principles of Christianity and is vehement in its anti-communism . 
They argue in favour of capitalism by promoting the sanctity of private property and individual enterprise . 
They are keen promoters of Social Credit . 
They are strongly monarchist and completely opposed to Australian republicanism and see the links to <Location>Great Britain</Location> as being fundamental to Australian identity . 
The <Org>League</Org> has been accused of being associated with the now-defunct <Org>Australian National Socialist Party</Org> . 
Former Western Australian <Org>Labor</Org> MP , founder of the <Org>Australia First Party</Org> and later <Org>One Nation</Org> member <Person>Graeme Campbell</Person> was associated with the <Org>League</Org> at the same time as he was a member of <Org>One Nation</Org> and <Org>Australia First</Org> . 
Mr <Person>Campbell</Person> stated that " <Org>Australia First</Org> has no association with the <Org>League</Org> . 
It 's me with the association . " 
Former treasurer <Person>Peter Costello</Person> stated that <Org>One Nation</Org> 's policy of a state bank which would issue low-interest loans was directly taken from the <Org>ALOR</Org> , and that " the <Org>League of Rights</Org> is driving its policy in relation to banking and money " 
The Australian branch of the <Org>B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission</Org> issued a press release that " The Co-founder of <Org>Australians Against Further Immigration</Org> ( <Org>AAFI</Org> ) , and <Org>One Nation</Org> 's Victorian leader <Person>Robyn Spencer</Person> has addressed numerous <Org>League of Rights</Org> meetings as well as delivered a speech with <Org>League of Rights</Org> , Advisory National Director <Person>Eric Butler</Person> . " 
<Org>ALOR</Org> is also allegedly associated with <Org>National Action</Org> 
In the 1970s and early 1980s , the <Org>League</Org> attempted to gain control of the <Org>National Party of Australia</Org> , encouraging members to join the party in sufficient numbers to take control , a tactic known as entryism . 
<Person>Doug Anthony</Person> led an effort to defend the Party from the <Org>League</Org> by recruiting people who would vote against them . 
After a long struggle over several years , the existing leadership prevailed . 
A surprising consequence of this struggle was that the <Org>National Party</Org> , which got far fewer votes than either the <Org>Labor</Org> or <Org>Liberal</Org> parties , had more members . 
This fact became much more widely known than the reason for it , with both sides keeping the struggle out of the media . 
It has been associated with the now-defunct <Org>New Zealand League of Rights</Org> , the <Org>Canadian League of Rights</Org> and through the <Org>British League of Rights</Org> also the <Org>John Birch Society</Org> in the <Location>United States</Location> . 
Critics have pointed to the past participation of the <Org>League</Org> in the former <Org>World Anti-Communist League</Org> alongside dictatorial regimes like that of <Person>Augusto Pinochet</Person> .

The <Location>Ayalon Cave</Location> is a large underground limestone cave located near <Location>Ramla</Location> , <Location>Israel</Location> . 
The cave , 300 feet deep , with its branch extends almost 2.5 kilometres making it the second largest limestone cave in <Location>Israel</Location> . 
Researchers announced that they have so far discovered eight new species , all without eyes , including four crustacean species and four terrestrial species , previously unknown to science . 
They added that the crustaceans included two saltwater species and two freshwater species , indicating that this diversity might help better understand the water history of the region . 
The cave was first discovered when a small opening was discerned in a quarry near <Location>Ramla</Location> . 
According to Professor <Person>Amos Frumkin</Person> of the <Org>Hebrew University</Org> , the cave is unique in that a thick layer of chalk left it impermeable to water . 
The cave will remain closed to the public to allow scientific investigation to continue undisturbed . 
As the cave was completely cut off from the outside environment , it sustained an independent ecosystem ; this ecosystem did not rely on sunlight and photosynthesis , or on organic compounds , for an energy source . 
Rather , energy was extracted by Chemoautotrophic bacteria , living in a film on top of the pool water . 
These bacteria produce energy by oxidizing the sulfide compounds in the water , and derive organic compounds using carbon dioxide from the air . 
These compounds form the basis of the cave 's ecosystem .

<Location>Bank Hey</Location> ( also <Location>Sunnybower</Location> or <Location>Sunny Bower</Location> ) is a suburb of <Location>Blackburn</Location> , <Location>Lancashire</Location> , <Location>England</Location> . 
It is located to the east of the town , north of <Location>Whitebirk</Location> and near the boundary with <Location>Hyndburn</Location> . 
The Battle of Hulao ( шчЂфЙцА ) of 28 May 621 , located just east of <Location>Luoyang</Location> , was a decisive victory for <Person>Li Shimin</Person> , through which he was able to subdue two warlords , <Person>Dou Jiande</Person> and <Person>Wang Shichong</Person> . 
<Person>Li Shimin</Person> led a siege on the city of <Location>Luoyang</Location> , head of the self-declared emperor <Person>Wang Shichong</Person> , who solicited help from <Person>Dou Jiande</Person> from the east . 
However , <Person>Dou Jiande</Person> delayed and when he finally arrived , <Person>Li Shimin</Person> brought forces to meet the new threat . 
<Person>Li Shimin</Person> 's army avoided conflict until the troops of <Person>Dou Jiande</Person> were exhausted and then led a cavalry charge , effectively capturing <Person>Dou Jiande</Person> . 
Afterwards , <Person>Wang Shichong</Person> , seeing no other choice , surrendered <Location>Luoyang</Location> . 
<Person>Dou Jiande</Person> was later executed , resulting in some of his followers , led by <Person>Liu Heita</Person> , raising an unsuccessful rebellion against <Person>Tang</Person> . 
The French <Org>Voulet-Chanoine Mission</Org> , led by the captains <Person>Paul Voulet</Person> and <Person>Julien Chanoine</Person> , had been dispatched in 1898 to <Location>Africa</Location> by the <Org>French government</Org> with the mission to conquer the territories between the <Location>Niger River</Location> and <Location>Lake Chad</Location> and join in uniting French territories in <Location>West Africa</Location> . 
After leaving <Location>French Sudan</Location> in January 1899 , they ruthlessly subjected the native peoples , meeting little resistance . 
One of the few to resist was the sorcerer queen <Person>Sarraounia</Person> , ruler of the Azna , a pagan people in a long Islamized region . 
Determinated to bar the expedition 's road , <Person>Sarraounia</Person> wrote to <Person>Voulet</Person> a provocative letter full of insults ; the French took up the challenge , and on April 15 left the camp marching towards the villages of <Location>Lougou</Location> and <Location>Tougana</Location> , where <Person>Sarraounia</Person> had concentrated her forces . 
The day after , at 6:00 , started what Lt . 
<Person>Paul Joalland</Person> called " one of the hottest moment of the campaign " . 
The French found the enemy assembled on the field , while women and children had already retired themselves in a small thick and almost impenetrable bush where the Azna defended themselves when facing a superior enemy . 
After the Azna had started to sisperse under the French gunfire , their lines broke when hit by three grapeshot balls ; the Azna then retreated in the bush , where the thick foliage partly protected the natives from the gunfire . 
The French felt that if left there , the Azna may attack them at night ; so it was decideed to assault the bush , but being careful to leave a way of escape for the Azna open , so to avoid a too deadly confrontation that could cost too much blood . 
The French met a strong resistance , killing 2 riflemen and wounding 4 , but were at the end successful and forced the Azna to escape . 
The battle had protracted itself till 13:00 , and among the French tirailleurs 4 were killed and 6 wounded , with 7,000 cartridges consummed . 
The Battle of Vilcapugio was fought on October 1 , 1813 during the Campaign of Alto Peru in the Argentine War of Independence , where the pro-independence forces led by General <Person>Manuel Belgrano</Person> were defeated by the pro-Spanish Realists , led by <Person>Joaquin de la Pazuela</Person> . 
The Campaign was restarted upon the insistence of the government in <Location>Buenos Aires</Location> after the <Org>Army of the North</Org> 's victories during the Battles of TucumУЁn and <Location>Salta</Location> . 
Despite having malaria and having to command a company of new conscripts with insufficient artillery , <Person>Belgrano</Person> accepted the commanding post . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army was supported by Colonel <Person>Baltasar CУЁrdenas</Person> and the 2,000 poorly organized natives under his command , and Colonel <Person>Cornelio Zelaya</Person> with forces from <Location>Cochabamba</Location> . 
Both colonels had orders to incite rebellion amongst the indigenous populations who provided the realists with valuable information . 
Knowing that the realist army did not have enough mules to move its artillery and provisions , <Person>Belgrano</Person> planned to use a pincer movement to attack , confidently believing that <Person>Pezuela</Person> would not provide much resistance . 
At the end of September 1813 , most of <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army arrived in the prairie of <Location>Vilcapugio</Location> , which was a plateau surrounded by tall mountains to the north of <Location>PotosУ­</Location> . 
The realist troops were encamped at <Location>Condo-Condo</Location> under the orders of <Person>Pazuela</Person> and Major <Person>Saturnino Castro</Person> , which allowed them to cut off <Person>CУЁrdenas</Person> ' troops and any communication between <Person>Belgrano</Person> and the Cochabamban forces . 
<Person>Castro</Person> also attained documents from <Person>CУЁrdenas</Person> giving instructions to <Person>Belgrano</Person> . 
With these documents <Person>Pazuela</Person> was able to interrupt <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's plans and began his advance on the mountains on October 1 . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army veterans from the North contained the left flank and center column of the realist army and forced them to back down until <Person>Pezuela</Person> recognized he was losing the battle at <Location>Virrey de Lima</Location> ; however , his own left flank remained in action and defeated <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's right column . 
The realist army reorganized itself and appropriated all of its artillery , continuously shelling the few soldiers left in <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's encampment . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> and <Person>Eustaquio DУ­az VУЉlez</Person> had decided that <Person>Vel</Person> would be the one to go to <Location>PotosУ­</Location> to reunite with the dispersed troops . 
<Person>DУ­az VУЉlez</Person> took command over the troops in <Location>PotosУ­</Location> after <Person>Vilcapugio</Person> with the rest of the army on the left flank of the enemy . 
At this point the troops organized themselves to pursue the Campaign of Alto PerУК according the orders of the government of <Location>Buenos Aires</Location> .

<Person>Benjamin Stoloff</Person> ( 6 October 1895 - 8 September 1960 ) , best known as <Person>Ben Stoloff</Person> , was an American film director and producer . 
He began his career as a short film comedy director and gradually moved into feature film directing and production later in his career . 
<Person>Stoloff</Person> was born in <Location>Philadelphia</Location> , <Location>Pennsylvania</Location> , <Location>USA</Location> . 
He died in <Location>Hollywood</Location> , <Location>California</Location> . 
<Person>Benny Lee Boynton</Person> ( born December 6 , 1898 ) was an American football player . 
He was elected to the <Org>College Football Hall of Fame</Org> in 1962 . 
He played professionally for the <Org>Rochester Jeffersons</Org> and <Org>Buffalo Bisons</Org> 
<Person>Ben Player Ben</Person> is the current 2007 World Champion . 
He is known for his flawless bodyboarding style and massive charging . 
His victory came after placing second ( narrowly being defeated by <Person>Damian King</Person> ) in the 2006 Pipeline final . 
He has finished # 2 overall on the world bodyboarding tour several times . 
<Person>Ben</Person> now also helps run <Org>Movement Bodyboarding Magazine</Org> . 
The Shark Island Challenge is <Location>Australia</Location> 's richest bodyboarding competition , bankrolled to the tune of $120,000 . 
But as they say , money ca n't buy love -- or , as was the case in July 2005 , wave action . 
When the month-long waiting period ran out without a hint of swell , organisers were forced to put the outcome in the hands of competitors . 
And so the first stop on the World Bodyboarding Tour would be decided by a vote : either split the prize money and the championship points evenly between all competitors , or run the comp in the puny swell benignly flopping over a rock ledge usually famous for its forbidding risk to life and limb . 
" I just thought , ' You fools , this is what we do ' , " says <Person>Ben Player</Person> , one of only two pro riders who voted to compete . 
At 28 , he sensed his chances of ever winning a world title receding with each hand raised in opposition : he had fancied his chances at the infamous <Location>Island</Location> . 
Retreating to his car , he broke down and cried , angered and frustrated by his peers ' reluctance to man up at a spot that has always rewarded the brave . 
He paddled out anyway , an overt display of defiance against the group 's decision - albeit a failed one . 
" I ended up cutting my hand pretty badly on the reef . 
It was n't rideable at all ... " 
Six months later he was in <Location>Hawaii</Location> in January 06 for the final stop on the world tour . 
The irony of that frigid afternoon in <Location>Cronulla</Location> did n't dawn on <Person>Player</Person> as he paddled out in flawless , two-metre waves for the final of the Pipeline Pro ; he was too preoccupied with matters at hand . 
After further tour stops in <Location>Chile</Location> , <Location>Portugal</Location> and Maui , the two riders left in the hunt for the 2006 crown were the same pair who had voted in favour of going ahead at <Location>Shark Island</Location> - <Person>Ben Player</Person> and Queenslander <Person>Mitchell Rawlins</Person> . 
With <Person>Rawlins</Person> knocked out in the quarters , <Person>Ben</Person> needed to place at least second in the final to realise his dream of becoming world champ . 
His surfing in that 30-minute final was truly world class , combining clean barrels with solid boosts . 
<Person>Ben</Person> opened up a lead early that he would hold on to through to the siren . 
Not just the master of Pipeline , but champion of the world ... 
Then , further controversy . 
In the hazy , backlit conditions of the late afternoon , it was revealed that the judges had confused the riders , awarding <Person>Player</Person> the points for a ride his opponent had made . 
Scores were hastily revised , then the gutting news : <Person>Player</Person> had been relegated to runner-up , just moments before he was due to be presented with the Pipeline trophy . 
The confusion soured the occasion . 
But <Person>Ben Player</Person> was bodyboarding 's newest world champion . 
This month <Person>Player</Person> returns to <Location>Hawaii</Location> to defend his title . 
No such contest debacles this year , which means <Person>Ben Player</Person> is more ambitious than ever to win it clean . 
And again it will all come down to Pipeline , where his performances every winter since he first arrived as a wiry 16-year-old have made him a stand out , no matter what surfcraft you favour , as even the greatest surfer on the planet will attest . 
" <Person>Ben</Person> gets a fair share of respect from the crew there , " says <Person>Kelly Slater</Person> . 
" He does n't really say all that much but seems to get the job done right . 
He has a good eye for how to ride a wave . 
A great surfer is a great surfer , no matter what they ride . " 
That wiry frame has filled out during the 13 seasons he 's spent hassling for waves amongst the hungry pack of board riders who converge on the famous stretch of sand every northern winter . 
He shares physical traits with his brother <Person>Toby</Person> , also a pro bodyboarder and half the reason why the name <Person>Player</Person> has been tattooed on everything bodyboarding since the sport 's boom days of the mid-1990s . 
" You ca n't help but be competitive with your brother , " <Person>Ben</Person> says of their early years riding the wedging peaks of <Location>Whale Beach</Location> , on <Location>Sydney</Location> 's northern beaches . 
As the younger sibling , <Person>Ben</Person> was constantly surfing with guys his senior , something he feels refined his talent and drive . 
" The fact <Person>Toby</Person> was more popular than me just made me even more competitive . " 
In fact <Person>Ben Player</Person> 's biography reflects the twists and turns of the phenomenal growth of this comparatively new sport . 
<Person>Player</Person> won Australian titles as a cadet ( under-16s ) and as a pro in 2000 , part of the new generation that reshaped bodyboarding in <Location>Australia</Location> . 
This crew put new emphasis on style and fluidity in big moves and heavy situations , keeping their bodies and legs tight and in control through monstrous airs , milking power out of the pocket of the wave -- the bowl that forms in front of the barrelling section . 
His progressive riding and surfer-good looks made him the complete package , but at 24 , when he might have been cashing in , his seat at the head of bodyboarding 's table was kicked out from under him . 
At the start of the new millennium , surf brands began pulling out of bodyboarding . 
" Three years ago I lost both sponsors on the same day . 
[ Surfwear label ] <Org>Quiksilver</Org> totally pulled out of bodyboarding and the company distributing <Org>Morey</Org> boards went bankrupt , so of course my contract went bust . 
Basically I lost $85,000 for that year and $35,000 that was owed to me , " says <Person>Player</Person> . 
<Person>Player</Person> pinpoints <Person>Mike Stewart</Person> -- the undisputed guru of bodyboarding who had pioneered the sport -- for kick-starting an era of self-reliance and self-belief , backed by his call to " support those who support bodyboarding " . 
A kind of evangelistic patriotism swept through the sport . 
First came the launch of bodyboard-specific clothing brands , then wetsuits and accessories . 
Now bodyboarding specific stores have opened to cater for the newly independent industry . 
" The sport is in a much better position now , " <Person>Player</Person> will tell you . 
" It 's still growing , but with the money remaining in bodyboarding . " 
The thought of quitting never entered his head . 
" It was more a question of ' How am I going to make ends meet ? " 
He 'd always harboured a creative streak , was an avid scribe within the sport and a self-taught graphic designer ... The answer seems obvious now : <Person>Player</Person> pooled the last of his savings with a couple of friends and launched a magazine . 
" The only other bodyboarding magazine on the market was aimed at a young teenage audience , and here I was 20-something and I could n't relate . 
I wanted to make something I could show people and say , ' Hey , this is what I do . ' " 
For the first two years <Person>Player</Person> sold advertising for the mag , which was named <Org>Movement</Org> . 
It now employs four people ( yes , including this author ) . 
<Person>Player</Person> 's been able to step away from the day-to-day business , but the magazine is a venture that will keep him firmly rooted in the sport . 
It has even re-energised his passion for the sport . 
" The more I worked on <Org>Movement</Org> the more stoked I became on bodyboarding again . " 
As the street cred of bodyboarding evolved , so did the dynamics of the sport . 
Bodyboarders now seek out the sort of aquatic slabs breaking in shallow water that stand-up surfers leave alone . 
" On a bodyboard you can handle much steeper situations . 
Being prone means you can ride over very shallow , ledging reefs , sometimes just inches deep , where you wo n't get knocked off by steps in the wave . " 
This extreme element comes with heavy consequences . 
During a contest in <Location>Tahiti</Location> a few years ago , <Person>Player</Person> pulled into a barrel that shut down on him . 
When he finally came up for air , he was bleeding from both ears from the sheer pressure exerted by the imploding wave . 
" I think surfing actually embraces bodyboarding much more now , because it 's not really seen as competition -- we 're something totally different , " he says . 
" We 're surfing our own waves and we 've got our own industry . " 
The revamped world tour now showcases the sport at surf breaks that suit the craft . 
<Location>Shark Island</Location> is one of the best examples of this , the shallow rock bottom creating a warping barrel with an ideal end section which allows them to launch into aerial manoeuvres . 
The contest site in <Location>Chile</Location> is similar , though a true peak that barrels both ways . 
Then there is <Location>Hawaii</Location> 's <Location>Pipeline</Location> , the ideal of perfection whether you 're standing up or lying down . 
<Location>Portugal</Location> is the exception on the tour , a playful beach break , but it retains its status on the tour due to the carnival atmosphere that the sport attracts in <Location>Europe</Location> , as well as in <Location>South America</Location> . 
In <Location>Australia</Location> , the majority of top pros tend to remain nameless outside the sport 's domain ; in <Location>Europe</Location> they are feted like rock gods , mobbed by adoring fans wherever they go . 
The organisers of the world tour -- now chaired by Mr Bodyboarding himself , <Person>Mike Stewart</Person> -- say they are n't done yet with their expansion , but they 're certainly got the sport on its feet ... so to speak . 
But for now the eyes of the bodyboarding world are again squinting out towards the chunk of lava that lies submerged off the <Location>North Shore</Location> of <Location>Oahu</Location> . 
Mixed results on tour this year have <Person>Ben Player</Person> trailing on points in the race for the championship title , but he 's been in <Location>Hawaii</Location> for two months honing his act in preparation for his world title defence in mid-to-late January . 
If the waves stay away and the top pros had to vote their champion in , you could count on <Person>Player</Person> power winning the day .

The chain was founded by <Person>Herman Salling</Person> , but is now a part of <Org>Dansk Supermarked</Org> . 
The name <Org>Bilka</Org> is believed by many to be a mix of the German Billiges Kaufhaus ( low-price department store ) , which its founder , <Person>Herman Salling</Person> had encountered during his business trips to <Location>West Germany</Location> . 
However , <Person>Herman Salling</Person> has himself stated that <Org>Bilka</Org> is a combination of the words bil ( car ) and ka ( can ) , referring to the car accessibility to the stores .

<Location>B&SR</Location> design was based on experience of the <Location>Sandy River Railroad</Location> . 
<Org>Hinkley Locomotive Works</Org> modified their 2-foot gauge Forney design to run boiler first with an extended frame similar to that installed on <Location>Sandy River Railroad</Location> # 1 following a wreck in early 1882 . 
The successful design of the Bridgton Hinkleys was subsequently repeated for the <Location>Monson Railroad</Location> and the <Location>Franklin and Megantic Railway</Location> . 
Construction began in 1882 , and trains were running to <Location>Bridgton</Location> by early 1883 . 
<Location>B&SR</Location> used early profits to replace wooden trestles with earthen fills . 
A 14-foot granite masonry arch was constructed over <Location>Hancock Brook</Location> in 1895 . track was extended to <Location>Harrison</Location> with 35 # steel rails in 1898 . 
Trestles on the <Location>Harrison</Location> extension had been replaced by earthen fills and plate girder bridges by 1906 . 
Original <Org>Hinkley</Org> locomotives # 1-2 were replaced by # 5-6 of an improved design with pilot wheels . 
<Location>B&SR</Location> then replaced the original 30 # steel rails from <Location>Bridgton Junction</Location> to <Location>Bridgton</Location> with 48 # and 50 # steel rails from <Location>1907</Location> to <Location>1910</Location> before <Location>Maine Central Railroad</Location> secured control of the <Location>B&SR</Location> in 1912 . 
Under <Location>Maine Central</Location> operation , there were 4 mixed train round trips daily from <Location>Harrison</Location> to <Location>Bridgton Junction</Location> and return . 
The first left <Location>Harrison</Location> at 5:15 AM and the last returned to <Location>Harrison</Location> at 8:45 PM . 
Train speed seldom exceeded 20 miles per hour . 
Two passenger train sets were required for this service . 
The first consisted of baggage # 10 , RPO # 25 , and one or two coaches . 
A couple of bench seats at one end of baggage-RPO # 11 provided smoking accommodation for the second train set . 
Freight traffic in 1913 was 18% outbound lumber , 15% outbound pulpwood , 15% inbound coal , 11% outbound apples and canned corn , 11% manufactured goods , 10% feed & grain , 10% express , and 2% inbound petroleum products . 
Locomotive # 8 was the last locomotive built for the <Location>Maine</Location> 2-foot gauge railways . 
Bond interest went unpaid in 1926 , and the town of <Location>Bridgton</Location> began a 15-year effort to preserve their railroad . 
The <Location>B&SR</Location> was reorganized as the <Location>Bridgton</Location> and <Location>Harrison</Location> ; but the extension to <Location>Harrison</Location> was dismantled after locomotive # 8 tipped over when the 35 # rails sagged in 1930 . 
Locomotive # 8 was the heaviest locomotive on any 2-foot gauge railway in <Location>Maine</Location> . 
<Location>B&SR</Location> became a tourist attraction as the last 2-foot gauge railroad offering passenger service in the late 1930 's .

The capture gun , also called a dart gun , is an invention which was refined by a team headed by Dr <Person>Tony Pooley</Person> and Dr <Person>Toni Harthoorn</Person> in <Location>Kenya</Location> in the early 1960 's . 
Since then it has become the standard tool for capture of large and medium-sized animals to transport them safely . 
The original piston-operated medium-bore gun fired a tranquilizer dart which is a syringe which was loaded with a dose of barbiturate and / or other drugs , backed by a ball bearing which was separated from the drug mix with a wadding . 
On impact with the animal the inertial momentum of the balls injects the drug into the animal , causing torpor and prostration within minutes . 
Because of the power of the drugs the handlers then have to move quickly to secure the animal for transport , monitor its vital signs , protect its eyes and ears , and then inject reversing drugs when needed . 
Many large animals are acutely sensitive to stress and can easily die without careful treatment . 
One major discovery by Dr <Person>Harthoorn</Person> 's team was that different species , despite being of roughly equal size ( for example the rhinoceros and the buffalo ) needed very different doses and spectra of drugs to safely immobilise them . 
In some species the margin of error is very small indeed . 
Modern capture guns are gas-fired and collapsible . 
Several models are available .

<Org>CBS Cable</Org> was an early cable network operated by <Org>CBS , Inc.</Org> , dedicated to the lively arts ( i.e. symphony , dance , theatre , opera , etc . ) . 
It debuted in October 1981 and ceased operations on December 17 , 1982 . 
<Org>CBS Cable</Org> was a personal project of <Org>CBS</Org> founder <Person>William Paley</Person> , who hoped it would blaze a trail for cultural programming in the then-emerging cable television medium . 
Its program offerings were ambitious and often critically praised . 
Nevertheless the network struggled , and ultimately failed , largely because of the reluctance of many cable systems across the <Location>United States</Location> to give it carriage , limiting severely its ability to attract both viewers and advertisers for its costly lineup of programming . 
Cable systems in the early 1980s had far more limited channel capacity than they do today ( usually only a few dozen channels in most cities ) . 
<Org>CBS Cable</Org> was competing for channel space by appealing to a select and relatively small upscale audience , while other networks coming on line at the same time such as <Org>MTV</Org> and <Org>ESPN</Org> promised larger and more broad-based viewership and therefore got cable operators to carry them far more easily . 
<Org>MTV</Org> and <Org>ESPN</Org> thrived and gave rise to additional companion channels within a short time , while the <Org>CBS Cable</Org> channel folded after just over 14 months in operation . 
Not to be confused with the CBS-operated cable network , <Org>Eye On People</Org> , which debuted in 1997 and soon turned into <Org>Discovery People</Org> , ultimately reorganized into <Org>Discovery Times</Org> .

He wrote the script for the Doctor Who serial Kinda in 1982 . 
This script drew heavily on his own Buddhist faith and incorporated classic Buddhist terms such as dukkha , panna , karuna , devaloka and Mara --- indeed , " the Mara " was the name of the villain of the piece .

<Location>Circuit Park Zandvoort</Location> is a motorsport race track located in the dunes near the town of <Location>Zandvoort</Location> , in the <Location>Netherlands</Location> , near the <Location>North Sea</Location> coast line . 
Although there were plans for races at <Location>Zandvoort</Location> before World War II , the first street race was held on June 3 , 1939 . 
A real circuit was not built until after the war , mainly designed by <Person>John Hugenholtz</Person> . 
The circuit was inaugurated on August , 7 , 1948 . 
Next year , in 1949 the circuit hosted the Zandvoort Grand Prix . 
It remained on the <Org>F1</Org> calendar for 30 out of the next 34 years . 
The company that commercially ran the circuit ( <Org>CENAV</Org> ) went out of business , marking the end of <Location>Circuit Zandvoort</Location> . 
The track , owned by the municipality of <Location>Zandvoort</Location> , was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to <Org>Vendorado</Org> , a Bungalow park developer at that time . 
A plan to save the remaining track was made by a group of people and companies . 
In 1995 , <Org>CPZ</Org> got the " A Status " of the Dutch government and began building an international Grand Prix Circuit . 
One of the major events that is currently held at the circuit , along with DTM and A1GP , is the BP Ultimate Masters of Formula 3 , where <Org>Formula 3</Org> cars of several national racing series compete with each other ( originally called Marlboro Masters , before tobacco advertising ban ) . 
The most famous corner in the circuit is the <Location>Tarzanbocht</Location> ( <Location>Tarzan corner</Location> ) which provides excellent overtaking opportunities . 
This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of <Person>Tarzan</Person> and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track 's designers named a nearby corner after him . 
On the other hand , many different stories about <Location>Tarzan Corner</Location> are known . 
<Location>Circuit Park Zandvoort</Location> played host to the first race in the 2006/07 season of A1 Grand Prix from 29 September - 1 October 2006 . 
In the history of the circuit , several fatal accidents have occurred . 
The older ' Classic ' <Location>Zandvoort</Location> circuit layout from 1967 is modeled in detail and can be driven in the Grand Prix Legends racing simulation for X86-based pc's . 
This was later converted to NASCAR 4 , NASCAR 2002 , 2003 and other simulations using a converter from website ' The Pits ' . 
The current layout is used in the <Org>SimBin</Org> game RACE 07 - Official WTCC Game .

Nobel laureate <Person>James D. Watson</Person> ( who co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA with <Person>Francis Crick</Person> ) served as the Laboratory 's Director and President for 35 years , and later assumed the role of Chancellor . 
In October 2007 <Person>Watson</Person> resigned as a result of controversial remarks about race made to <Org>The Sunday Times</Org> in the <Location>U.K</Location> . 
Currently , cancer biologist <Person>Bruce Stillman</Person> serves as laboratory President . 
During the years 1910 to 1940 , the laboratory was also the home of the <Org>Eugenics Record Office</Org> of biologist <Person>Charles B. Davenport</Person> and his assistant <Person>Harry H. Laughlin</Person> , two prominent American eugenicists of the period . 
In 1935 the <Org>Carnegie Institution</Org> sent a team to review their work , and as a result the <Org>ERO</Org> was ordered to stop all efforts . 
In 1939 the Institute withdrew funding for the <Org>ERO</Org> entirely , leading to its closure . 
Their reports , articles , charts , and pedigrees were considered scientific " facts " in their day , but have since been discredited . 
However , this closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ( Immigration Act of 1924 ) , which severely reduced the number of immigrants to <Location>America</Location> from southern and eastern <Location>Europe</Location> who , <Person>Harry Laughlin</Person> testified , were racially inferior than the Nordic immigrants from <Location>England</Location> and <Location>Germany</Location> . 
Aside from its scientific mission , the laboratory is host to world-class scientific conferences on a variety of topics . 
The first of the annual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Symposium on Quantitative Biology was held in 1934 . 
The Symposium in 1960 , Biological Clocks , was arguably the founding moment of the field of chronobiology . 
Now , over 24 meetings , in addition to the Symposium , for between 200 and 500 scientists , are held annually . 
The <Location>Banbury Center</Location> is a small conference center that holds discussion-style meetings for only 36 invited participants . 
These elite meetings cover often controversial topics in molecular biology and neuroscience . 
<Person>Salvador Luria</Person> and <Person>Max DelbrУМc</Person> founded the Phage Course in 1948 , a course that trained many of the leaders of the new field of molecular genetics . 
The courses proliferated under <Person>Watson</Person> 's guidance and each year some 28 advanced courses are held for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who travel to <Org>CSHL</Org> from throughout the world . 
The laboratory also offers many programs for students in high school and college in biotechnology and biology . 
The lab is particularly well known for its contributions towards the training of young scientists , notably through the establishment of its Undergraduate Research Program in 1959 , its <Location>Dolan DNA Learning Center</Location> in 1988 , and the founding of the <Org>Watson School of Biological Sciences</Org> in 1998 . 
The <Location>United States Penitentiary II</Location> in <Location>Coleman</Location> is a high security facility in the state of <Location>Florida</Location> housing male inmates .

Connecticut Classic Lotto is one of the games offered by the <Org>Connecticut Lottery</Org> . 
It is drawn twice a week , on Tuesdays and Fridays . 
The earliest version of the game began in 1983 as a pick-6-of-36 . 
Later it became a 6/40 game . 
The current 6/44 matrix was adopted in September 1989 . 
The in-state game underwent further changes , such as adding a cash option in 1997 , and switching to what proved to be an unpopular " wild card " version in 1998 . 
The name was changed to " Classic Lotto " , and the wild card ball disappeared , in May 1999 . 
The current game ( as of 2007 ) pays winners $2 for matching three numbers , with parimutuel prizes for matching more numbers . 
The jackpot is won if all six match . 
Top-prize winners choose lump sum or annuity within 60 days of claiming the jackpot . 
In the unlikely event that the annuity is chosen , the prize is paid in 21 yearly installments . 
The overall prize pool is 52% of sales , half of which goes toward the jackpot alone . 
As with all <Org>Connecticut Lottery</Org> games , the minimum age to play Classic Lotto is 18 . 
The Classic Lotto jackpot was most recently hit on June 8 , 2007 ; the jackpot is almost never shared by two or more tickets . 
Winners of Classic Lotto ( jackpot or otherwise ) have one year to claim their prizes . 
A Classic Lotto jackpot of $3.5 million ( annuity ) on a ticket bought in February 2006 went unclaimed . 
The <Org>Connecticut Lottery</Org> had several options for distributing the $2.1 million cash that would have funded the jackpot prize ; as of June 2007 , there has been no official word as to what the money will be used for . 
It is possible the money will go into future Classic Lotto drawings ; for a time in the mid-to-late 1990s , unclaimed jackpot cash was used to guarantee starting jackpots of $2 million , instead of the usual $1 million . 
Since <Location>Connecticut</Location> is a member of the <Org>Multi-State Lottery Association</Org> ( <Org>MUSL</Org> ) , it is eligible to offer its other multi-state games . 
One of these is the annuitized jackpot game Hot Lotto , played the same as its flagship game Powerball ; however , <Location>Connecticut</Location> is planning to continue Classic Lotto into at least 2009 .

<Person>Snoke</Person> received his PhD in physics from the <Org>University of Illinois</Org> at <Location>Urbana-Champaign</Location> . 
He has worked for <Org>The Aerospace Corporation</Org> and was a visiting scientist and Fellow at the <Org>Max Planck Institute</Org> . 
His research has focused on basic processes and phase transitions of electrons , holes , including nonequilibrium dynamics of electron plasma and excitons , the Mott transition from exciton gas to electron-hole plasma and Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons and polaritons . 
His research group at the <Org>university of Pittsburgh</Org> uses stress to trap excitons in confined regions , similar to the way atoms are confined in traps for Bose-Einstein condensation experiments . 
His book , A Biblical Case for an Old Earth was described in a review by Law Professor <Person>David W. Opderbeck</Person> , in the <Org>American Scientific Affiliation</Org> 's Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith as " succeed[ing ] admirably " in " establish[ing ] that the ' day-age ' view is a valid alternative for Christians who hold to biblical inerrancy " , but as " less persuasive " at " argu[ing ] for a concordist understanding of the Genesis texts and modern science . " 
<Person>Snoke</Person> was elected a Fellow of the <Org>American Scientific Affiliation</Org> in 2006 . 
In 2004 co-authored an article , with <Person>Michael Behe</Person> , a senior fellow of the <Org>Discovery Institute</Org> 's <Org>Center for Science and Culture</Org> , in the scientific journal <Org>Protein Science</Org> , which received widespread criticism . 
<Person>Behe</Person> has stated that the results of the paper support his notion of irreducible complexity , based on the calculation of the probability of mutations required for evolution to succeed . 
<Person>Michael Lynch</Person> authored a response , to which <Person>Behe</Person> and <Person>Snoke</Person> responded . 
<Org>Protein Science</Org> discussed the papers in an editorial . 
On May 7 , 2005 , <Person>Behe</Person> described the paper in presenting arguments for irreducible complexity in his testimony at the <Location>Kansas</Location> evolution hearings . 
At the <Person>Kitzmiller</Person> v. <Org>Dover Area School District</Org> trial later that year it was the one article referenced by both <Person>Behe</Person> and <Person>Scott Minnich</Person> as supporting intelligent design . 
In his ruling , Judge <Person>Jones</Person> noted that " A review of the article indicates that it does not mention either irreducible complexity or ID . 
In fact , Professor <Person>Behe</Person> admitted that the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were used . "

<Org>Squirrel</Org> participated in a number of national music events , including Light Music Contest in 1984 at <Org>Teater Terbuka</Org> , <Location>TIM</Location> , <Location>Indonesia</Location> . 
Though many contestants participated , it was <Person>Budjana</Person> and his fellow bandmates who outperformed the competition and won . 
One year after that , <Person>Budjana</Person> decided to fly to <Location>Jakarta</Location> in order to expand his music career . 
This journey lead him to <Person>Jack Lesmana</Person> , an Indonesian jazz legend , who introduced him to other professional musicians . 
Although <Person>Jack</Person> provided <Person>Budjana</Person> with opportunities in his Indonesian music career , it was <Person>Indra</Person> who first asked him to became a session player . 
A few years later , <Person>Budjana</Person> joined the band <Org>Spirit</Org> , which included <Person>Baron</Person> , <Org>Gigi</Org> 's former guitarist . 
With <Person>Budjana</Person> , <Org>Spirit</Org> released one self-titled album , before <Person>Budjana</Person> decided to leave the band and joined <Org>Java Jazz</Org> . 
He also sat in with many other bands --- including the <Org>Jimmy Manopo Band</Org> , <Org>Erwin Gutawa</Org> , <Org>Elfa 's Big Band</Org> and <Org>Twilite Orchestra</Org> --- and participated in the North Sea Jazz Festival , a world jazz convention in <Location>Den Haag</Location> , the <Location>Netherlands</Location> .

<Person>Diego Silang y Andaya</Person> ( December 16 , 1730 - May 28 , 1763 ) was raised as an Ilocano ; his father was Pangasinense . 
He was a revolutionary leader who conspired with British forces to overthrow the Spanish in the northern <Location>Philippines</Location> and establish an independent Ilocano nation . 
His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish tributes and abuses , and his belief in self-government , that the administration and leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and government in the <Location>Ilocos Region</Location> ( which at this time did not include <Location>Pangasinan</Location> ) should be led by trained Ilocano officials . 
Born in <Location>Aringay</Location> , <Location>Pangasinan</Location> ( an area in present-day <Location>Caba</Location> or <Location>Aringay</Location> , <Location>La Union</Location> ) , he worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in <Location>Vigan</Location> , <Location>Ilocos Sur</Location> . 
Bright , passionate and fluent in Spanish , he ferried correspondence from the <Location>Ilocos</Location> to <Location>Manila</Location> , journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seeds of rebellion . 
<Location>Spain</Location> allied with <Location>France</Location> during the Seven Years ' War against <Location>Great Britain</Location> . 
In so doing , the British sought to diminish the <Location>Spanish Empire</Location> . 
British naval forces took over <Location>Manila</Location> in October 1762 , that inspired uprisings in the farthest north of <Location>Ilocos Norte</Location> and <Location>Cagayan</Location> , where anti-Spanish sentiments festered . 
While <Person>Silang</Person> initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the <Location>Ilocos</Location> with native officials , and volunteered to head Ilocano forces against the British , desperate Spanish administrators transferred their powers to the Catholic Bishop of <Location>Nueva Segovia</Location> ( <Location>Vigan</Location> ) who in turn rejected <Person>Silang</Person> 's call . 
<Person>Silang</Person> 's group attacked the city and imprisoned its priests . 
He then began an association with the British who appointed him governor of the Ilocos on their behalf and promised him military reinforcement . 
The British force never materialized . 
He was killed by one of his friends , a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named <Person>Miguel Vicos</Person> who was paid by church authorities to assassinate him . 
After <Person>Diego Silang</Person> 's death , his wife , <Person>Josefa Gabriela</Person> , took over the revolt and fought courageously . 
A strong force was sent against her . 
She was forced to retreat to <Location>Abra</Location> . 
Riding a fast horse , <Person>Gabriela</Person> led her troops towards <Location>Vigan</Location> , but she was driven back . 
She fled again to <Location>Abra</Location> , where she was captured . 
On September 20 , 1763 , she and about 100 followers were executed by the Spanish authorities .

Digilogue is a music album of recordings which became the twentieth commercial release by the British avant-garde music group : <Org>zoviet*france</Org> : . 
It was first released in 1996 in limited edition 12 inch clear vinyl album format by the <Location>US</Location> record label , <Org>Soleilmoon Recordings</Org> . 
Subsequently , a CD version was released in 1998 by <Org>Soleilmoon Recordings</Org> , with additional tracks . 
The album 's title is an amalgamation of the words ' digital ' and ' analogue ' , two of the principal technologies that have been used in sound recording . 
The group have been quoted as adopting the failings in these technologies as a production technique in the creation of the album : " All audio equipment distorts sound to some degree and , eventually through mechanical and electrical failure , fucks it up . 
Since indeterminacy as a compositional parameter has been a constant in our work , this often produces what we regard as interesting new developments . 
digilogue was recorded using a mixture of failing analogue equipment and high-end digital equipment , and monitored in our studio exclusively on damaged hi-fi speakers . 
Sound can be as dirty and as clumsy as anything else we perceive with our senses . 
This is just as true of sound generated in the digital domain , much as we would all like to believe the claims of near-perfection made by audio equipment manufacturers . " 
" We were using digital equipment to produce the music but in a very analogue way . 
We were using sampling processes but in a very clumsy and coarse way . " 
Amber , from the CD version of the album , was used as the soundtrack to The Shop Floor , a video production by the artist <Person>Francis Gomila</Person> ( <Location>UK</Location> , 2003 ) . 
1996 edition

The island of <Location>Divar</Location> ( Divar-derived from the word Dipavati or ' small Island ' in Konkani ) lies in the state of <Location>Goa</Location> , <Location>India</Location> . 
It is located approximately 10 km from <Location>Panaji</Location> ( <Location>Panjim</Location> ) , and is approachable by ferry . 
The Island is connected to <Location>Old Goa</Location> on the south-east side , <Location>Ribandar</Location> , on the south-west side and <Location>Narve</Location> on the north side , all by ferry . 
A launch also connects <Location>Divar</Location> to the city of <Location>Panaji</Location> from further north-west , in the village of <Location>Vanxim</Location> . 
The <Location>Konkan Railway</Location> passes through the village and the nearest stop to the village is the train station at <Location>Karmali</Location> . 
The drive to the village is scenic , with paddy fields and wooded hills lacing the roadway , very typical of the Goan countryside . 
Though in a manner equally typical of modern <Location>Goa</Location> , of late the paddy fields lie fallow and overrun with weeds . 
The <Location>Island of Divar</Location> was a famous site of Hindu pilgrimage and hosted the the ancient temples of <Person>Shree Saptakoteshwar</Person> , <Person>Shree Ganesh</Person> and <Person>Shree Dwarkeshwar</Person> besides others . 
These were irreversibly destroyed by Portuguese zealots in the 16th century in their drive for Christianisation of <Location>Goa</Location> . 
The ancient site of Hindu pilgrimage is called <Org>Porne Tirth</Org> ( Old pilgrim spot-in Konkani ) even today . 
<Person>Rui Gomez Pereira</Person> in his book Goan temples and deities writes , " The original temple ( Of <Person>Shree Saptakoteshwar</Person> ) was constructed in the 12th century by the kings of <Person>Kadamba</Person> dynasty . 
<Person>Shree Saptakoteshwar</Person> was the patron Deity of the <Person>Kadambas</Person> . 
It was destroyed by the sultan of the <Location>Deccan</Location> in the middle of the 14th century and reconstructed at the same locality by <Person>Madhav Mantri</Person> of <Location>Vijaynagar</Location> at the close of the same century . 
It was again destroyed by the Portuguese in 1540 . " 
The <Person>Saptakoteshwar</Person> idol was shifted to <Location>Narve</Location> in <Location>Bicholim</Location> after the destruction of the temple by the Portuguese . 
The present temple in <Location>Narve</Location> , <Location>Bicholim</Location> was rebuilt by <Person>ShivajiRaje Bhonsale</Person> the Great Maratha leader . 
A Jesuit priest Fr <Person>Francisco Sousa</Person> documented the religious importance of " <Location>Divar</Location> " in his book Oriente Conquistado ( Conquest of the orient ) around the latter quarter of the 16th or early 17th century . 
Fr. <Person>Sousa</Person> testifies that " <Location>Divar</Location> was as much venerated by the Hindu Brahmins as the Holy land by us , on account of a temple of many indulgences and pilgrimages. .. " <Person>Rui Gomez Pereira</Person> details further stating , " The linga of the temple , made of five metals - gold , silver , copper , iron and bronze " was later relocated in <Location>Bicholim</Location> . 
And on the foundations of the same temple a prayer and catechism house was constructed in 1563 , which was later transformed into the chapel of <Person>Our Lady of Cande laria</Person> . " 
The original inhabitants of this island were people who once lived in <Location>Old Goa</Location> but had to desert during a disastrous pest that greatly reduced the population of <Location>Old Goa</Location> . 
<Location>Piedade</Location> , a small village is spread at the bottom of a small forested hillock on which there is the <Org>Church of Our Lady of Compassion</Org> . 
The island is dotted with well maintained , elegant Portuguese villas . 
From the top of the hill , superb panoramic views of the surrounding countryside , including <Location>Old Goa</Location> , the capital of <Location>Goa</Location> , <Location>Panaji</Location> , the meandering <Location>Mandovi river</Location> , and the bridges across it can be seen . 
The famous Bonderam festival is celebrated in <Location>Divar</Location> on the fourth Saturday of August during the monsoon with great fanfare and attended by thousands of tourists and locals . 
Bonderam Festival : The festival is a memoir to the dispute and the fury of the Villagers over the Portuguese system of resolving the disputes . 
The villagers on the <Location>Divar Island</Location> often indulged in some kind of fight over the matter of ownership of their lands . 
To stop the disputes the Portuguese , put up flags at the boundaries . 
The villagers did not like this system . 
So they protested against the Portuguese by throwing stones at the flags . 
On this day a carnival ambience is created . 
Each section of the village has a float at the parade . 
Melodious music could be heard throughout the village . 
The gaily colored floats accompanied by colorfully dressed youngsters make a pretty picture . 
The huge bell which today adorns the <Org>Se Cathedral</Org> in <Location>Old Goa</Location> was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who 'd made a vow that , were he to survive his fate , he would donate the ship 's bell to the first church village , town , or city his vessel touched . 
It so happened that that island was <Location>Divar</Location> . 
In keeping with his promise , he donated the bell to the church of <Location>Divar</Location> , which is located on a high hillock . 
Unfortunately though , every time the bell was struck , it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity , so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with that of the <Org>Se Cathedral</Org> . 
<Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> ( nУЉe <Person>Brende Mendelssohn</Person> ) ( October 24 1764 - August 3 1839 ) was a German novelist and translator . 
<Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> was born in 1764 in <Location>Berlin</Location> [1 ] . 
Oldest daughter of the philosopher <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> , a leading figure in the German Enlightenment ( Aufklarung ) . 
She married the merchant and banker <Person>Simon Veit</Person> in 1783 . 
Their son , <Person>Philipp Veit</Person> , would later become part of a circle of German Christian painters called " <Org>the Nazarenes</Org> , " who influenced the later English painters in the <Org>Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</Org> . 
She met the poet and critic <Person>Friedrich von Schlegel</Person> in the salon of her friend <Person>Henriette Herz</Person> , after which she left her husband . 
They were divorced in 1799 . 
She obtained custody of her younger son , <Person>Phillip</Person> , and lived with him at the <Org>ZiegelstraУe</Org> , which became a salon frequented by <Person>Tieck</Person> , <Person>Schelling</Person> , the <Person>Schlegel</Person> brothers , and <Person>Novalis</Person> . 
<Person>Schlegel</Person> 's novel " Lucinde " ( 1799 ) was seen as an account of their affair , causing a scandal in German literary circles . 
In 1801 her novel " Florentin " was published anonymously by <Person>Schlegel</Person> . 
They lived in <Location>Paris</Location> from 1802 until 1804 , and after her divorce they married as Protestants . 
In 1807lt she translated " Corinne " by <Person>Madame de StaУЋ</Person> from the French . 
In 1808 , <Person>Friedrich</Person> and <Person>Dorothea</Person> converted to Catholicism . 
( She may have adopted the name " <Person>Dorothea</Person> " from a 17th century <Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> who composed Catholic hymns ) . 
They continued to visit the salons of <Person>Rahel Levin</Person> and <Person>Henriette Herz</Person> , as well as the constellation which surrounded <Person>Madame de StaУЋ</Person> . 
<Person>Friedrich</Person> died in 1829 , after which she moved to <Location>Frankfurt am Main</Location> . 
There , she lived with her son <Person>Philipp</Person> ( also a convert to a medieval style of Catholicism ) until her death in 1839 . 
Since she was the daughter of the greatest Jewish philosopher of the Enlightenment - <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> - ( of equal stature with <Person>Immanuel Kant</Person> , and translator of <Person>John Locke</Person> and <Person>Alexander Pope</Person> , as well as Hebrew scriptures into German ) , <Person>Dorothea</Person> was surrounded throughout her life by the leading poets , critics , musicians , novelists , and philosophers of <Location>Europe</Location> . 
<Person>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</Person> was her father 's closest friend and colleague , and the Emancipation and secularization of the Jews and Jewish culture was a direct outcome of their work . 
( <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> was the model for <Person>Nathan der Weise</Person> in <Person>Lessing</Person> 's play of the same name . ) 
<Person>Friedrich the Great</Person> was <Person>Lessing</Person> 's patron , and he extended royal protection and sponsorship to <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> , as well . 
<Person>Dorothea</Person> 's brother , <Person>Joseph</Person> , was a friend and sponsor of <Person>Alexander von Humboldt</Person> , the great naturalist and ethnologist . 
Her nephew was <Person>Felix Mendelssohn</Person> , the composer , who with his sister , <Person>Fanny</Person> , were considered nearly the equals of the <Person>Mozarts</Person> as child prodigies . 
To fully appreciate the importance of this cultural scene , see the entries for <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> , <Person>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</Person> , <Person>Friedrich Schlegel</Person> , <Person>Germaine de StaУЋ</Person> , <Person>Felix Mendelssohn</Person> , <Person>Ludwi Tieck</Person> , <Person>Novalis</Person> , and others . 
<Person>Dorothea</Person> was the common link or nexus among them all . 
Most of her work , letters , biographies , etc. seem to be available only in German . 
And there , with the legacy of the Holocaust , she would seem to have an ambiguous status . 
The emancipation of European Jewry , in which she and her family played the greatest imaginable role , became the main target of the <Org>Third Reich</Org> and its Nuremberg Laws . 
For some Jews , she may be a less than admirable figure as well , having left her Jewish husband , violated her divorce settlement , and converted first to Protestantism ( which was favorable towards Judaism ) , and finally to Catholicism ( which was not ) . 
Most of her later friends were Christians , assimilated or intermarried Jews ( like <Person>Rahel Levin</Person> ) , or secular Deists and materialists . 
Her association with <Person>Germaine de StaУЋ</Person> was obviously of the greatest importance , since she was also the patron and literary companion of <Person>Dorothea</Person> 's second husband , <Person>Friedrich Schlegel</Person> . 
<Person>De StaУЋ</Person> was the daughter of <Person>Jacques Necker</Person> , <Person>Louis XVI</Person> 's finance minister , and a leading figure in the collapse of the <Person>Bourbons</Person> and the French Revolution . 
( See <Person>Christopher Herrold</Person> 's " Mistress to an Age . " ) 
It was probably through <Person>de StaУЋ</Person> 's husband , a Swedish Count , that the <Person>Schlegel</Person> 's were granted a title of nobility in the Swedish court . 
[ 1 ] In older literature and on her gravestone one finds the date 1763 , but this is the birthyear of her older sister <Person>Sara</Person> ( May 23rd 1763-April 15 1764 ) whose untimely death was one of the reasons <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> wrote the Phaedon .

<Person>Duane Bobick</Person> ( born 24 August , 1950 in <Location>Little Falls</Location> , <Location>Minnesota</Location> ) was a boxer from the <Location>United States</Location> , who became world amateur heavyweight champion in 1971 , and also won the gold medal at the 1971 Pan American Games . 
He fought for the <Location>United States</Location> at the 1972 Summer Olympics in <Location>Munich</Location> , <Location>West Germany</Location> , and later contended for the world heavyweight belt during the division 's most highly rated era . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> 's younger brother <Person>Rodney Bobick</Person> was also a heavyweight boxer , though less successful , and died in a single car crash in 1977 . 
Six foot , three inches tall and 215 pounds in his prime , <Person>Bobick</Person> was part of a boxing family and grew up with the sport in the 1960s . 
A tremendous puncher who developed well early by virtue of countless hours in the gym and ring , <Person>Bobick</Person> had an outstanding amateur career that included a win over <Location>Cuba</Location> 's famous <Person>TeУГfil Stevenson</Person> at the 197 Pan American Games . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> added another future champion to his list when he beat <Person>Larry Holmes</Person> to be named to the 1972 <Location>U.S.</Location> Olympic boxing team for the <Location>Munich</Location> Olympics . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was rated a star at this early stage , and may have been very overconfident as he met <Person>Stevenson</Person> again during the Olympic trials . 
Despite <Person>Bobick</Person> winning the second round , <Person>Stevenson</Person> knocked <Person>Bobick</Person> down in the third and the contest was stopped . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> trained hard to start his pro career , which did not begin until the following spring , 1973 . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> trained with and was managed by heavyweight legend <Person>Joe Frazier</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> 's first match was against <Person>Tommy Burns</Person> .

He also decisioned veteran boxer <Person>Billy Daniels</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was now 25-0 with 23 KOs . 
He was then rated by many to be the sport 's new " White Hope , " taking that label from then-declining <Person>Jerry Quarry</Person> . 
<Person>Frazier</Person> himself was approaching retirement and focusing on upcoming paydays with protege <Person>Bobick</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> gained top-10 ranking in 1975 with eight more fights and wins , all again by KO . 
He was now being dodged by some , but a win over <Person>Randy Neumann</Person> proved he could not be ignored . 
He had a tentative contract with <Person>Muhammed Ali</Person> in 1976 , but the fight never materialized . 
Instead he met and defeated <Person>Larry Middleton</Person> , fellow Minnesotan <Person>Scott LeDoux</Person> , <Person>Bunny Johnson</Person> and <Person>Chuck Wepner</Person> among his five 1976 fights , all wins with two KOs . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> had now improved enough as a boxer to be a legitimate title threat . 
He took a 38-0 record with 34 KO 's into the ring against powerful former champion <Person>Ken Norton</Person> in May 1977 . 
The two punchers went right after each other . 
<Person>Norton</Person> connected first and very hard . 
Following up on the staggered <Person>Bobick</Person> , <Person>Norton</Person> also landed a hard punch to <Person>Bobick</Person> 's windpipe but was never penalized . 
The fight lasted just one minute before <Person>Bobick</Person> was counted out . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was widely criticized after the <Person>Norton</Person> match and dismissed by many . 
Saturday Night Live made fun of <Person>Bobick</Person> by showing footage of his Nationally televised knockout loss , over and over again . 
Despite that , he was back in the ring two months later , winning a rematch with <Person>Scott LeDoux</Person> . 
He finished the year 1977 40-1 with 36 KO's . 
In 1978 , he was upset by South African puncher <Person>Kallie Knoetze</Person> for his second KO loss . 
He fought eight more times against second-tier fighters in 1978 , winning all by KO . 
He was looking to return to top-level contention in 1979 when he was KO 'd by future beltholder <Person>John Tate</Person> . 
Another KO loss to <Person>George Chaplin</Person> that year led to an announcement of retirement . 
His pro record was 48-4 with 42 KOs with wins over several notable contenders . 
All four of his pro losses were by KO . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> returned to <Location>Minnesota</Location> and took heavy industry work before a machine accident nearly killed him in 1997 . 
After that he went into coaching and public speaking , using his still-present celebrity to encourage and help others . 
In November 2006 , <Person>Bobick</Person> was elected as a city councilman for the <Location>City of Little Falls</Location> , <Location>Minnesota</Location> .

In 1875 he became director of the <Org>BurghУЖlzli asylum</Org> , as well as professor of psychiatry at the <Org>University of Zurich</Org> . 
In 1885 <Person>Hitzig</Person> became a professor at the <Org>University of Halle</Org> , where he remained until his retirement in 1903 . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> is remembered for his work concerning the interaction between electrical current and the brain . 
In 1870 , <Person>Hitzig</Person> assisted by anatomist <Person>Gustav Fritsch</Person> ( 1837-1927 ) , applied electricity via a thin probe to the exposed cerebral cortex of a dog without anesthesia . 
They performed these studies at the home of <Person>Fritsch</Person> because the <Org>University of Berlin</Org> would not allow such experimentation in their laboratories . 
What <Person>Hitzig</Person> and <Person>Fritsch</Person> had discovered is that electrical stimulation of different areas of the cerebrum caused involuntary muscular contractions of specific parts of the dog 's body . 
They identified the brains ' " motor strip " which is a vertical strip of brain tissue on the cerebrum in the back of the frontal lobe which controls different muscles in the body . 
In 1870 <Person>Hitzig</Person> published his findings in an essay called " On the Electrical Excitability of the Cerebrum " . This experimentation was considered the first time anyone had done any " localized study " regarding the brain and electrical current . 
However this was not the first time <Person>Hitzig</Person> had experienced the interaction between the brain and electricity ; earlier in his career as a physician working with the <Org>Prussian Army</Org> he experimented on wounded soldiers whose skulls were fractured by bullets . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> noticed that applying a small electrical current to the brains of these soldiers caused involuntary muscular movement . 
Apparently <Person>Hitzig</Person> 's crude experimentation was inspired by work of 18th century physicist <Person>Luigi Galvani</Person> who noticed this same electrical phenomena on the brains of frogs . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> and <Person>Fritsch</Person> 's work opened the door to further " localized testing " of the brain by many others including Scottish neurologist , <Person>David Ferrier</Person> .

The field exploits horizontal drilling technology by perforating the productive rocks parallel to the beds , rather than through a vertical well perpendicular to the relatively thin <Location>Bakken Formation</Location> . 
At <Location>Elm Coulee Field</Location> , the <Location>Bakken</Location> is only about 45 feet thick and lies at depths of 8,500 to 10,500 feet , but horizontal wells penetrate 3,000 to 5,000 feet of the reservoir rock , a porous dolomite of Devonian age that probably originated as a large carbonate bank on the western flank of the basin . 
The field is a stratigraphic trap . 
In 2006 , <Location>Elm Coulee</Location> was producing about 53,000 barrels of oil per day from more than 350 wells . 
Ultimate production is expected to exceed 270,000,000 barrels , with some estimates as high as 500,000,000 barrels . 
Production at <Location>Elm Coulee</Location> has more than doubled the oil output of the state of <Location>Montana</Location> .

EZ2DJ cabinet features a total of 10 speakers . 
There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen , and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine . 
The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks , so that both players may use their own headphones to enjoy the game 's audio . 
Using headphones does not disable the external speakers . 
EZ2DJ cabinet features four red effector buttons , located at the top of the controller part . 
However , unlike the Beatmania series ( including III and IIDX ) , depending on the gamemode , effector button are treated as a gameplay button , especially in the gamemode " Radio Mix " , where each player need to control 2 effector buttons . 
Essentially this is very similar to the 7 key mode of beatmania IIDX , but due to the location of these effector button --- located in a row right at center of the console panel , right underneath the screen and away from the keyboard --- it makes it even more difficult than beatmania IIDX in some occasion ( especially since it also use the pedal ) . 
Also , another gamemode named " Space Mix " uses all four buttons along with all keys and turn tables ( excludes pedals ) , becoming the hardest gamemode in the game . 
The pedal is used in all gameplay and treated as a gameplay button . 
But , in Space Mix , it is used as speed adjustor . 
EZ2DJ 's passing system is known as the " survival gauge " ; one needs to keep the gauge above 0% until the end of song to pass , similar to systems used in many dance-simulation games .
