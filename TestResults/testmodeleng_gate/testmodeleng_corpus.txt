010 is the tenth album from Japanese Punk Techno band The <Org>Mad Capsule Markets</Org> . 
This album proved to be more commercial and more techno-based than Osc-Dis , with heavily synthesized songs like Introduction 010 and Come . 
Founding member Kojima Minoru played guitar on Good Day , and Wardanceis cover of a song by <Location>UK</Location> post punk industrial band Killing Joke . 
XXX can of This had a different meaning , and most people did n't understand what the song was about . 
it was later explained that the song was about Cannabis ( ' can of this ' sounding like Cannabis when said faster ) it is uncertain if they were told to change the lyric like they did on P.O.P and HUMANITY . 
<Location>UK</Location> Edition came with the OSC-DIS video , and most of the tracks were re-engineered . 
The 139th was formed at <Location>Camp Howe</Location> , near <Location>Pittsburgh</Location> , on September 1 , 1862 . 
<Person>Frederick H. Collier</Person> was the first colonel . 
After burying the dead on the field of Second Battle of Bull Run , the regiment was attached to <Location>Howe</Location> 's Brigade of Couch 's <Person>Division</Person> of the <Org>IV Corps</Org> of the <Org>Army</Org> of the Potomac where it replaced De Trobriand 's 55th <Location>New York</Location> , <Person>Gardes Lafayette</Person> regiment on September 11 , 1862 . 
The composition of this brigade remained unchanged from this point until the war 's end and included the 62d <Location>NY</Location> , 93d PVI , 98th PVI and the 102d PVI . 
During this time Couch 's <Person>Division</Person> was detached from the <Org>Army</Org> and was occupied with guarding the fords on the Potomac . 
The 139th along with its brigade and division spent the next week marching from Poolesville to <Person>Sandy Hook</Person> , <Location>Maryland</Location> from where on September 17 , 1862 , it was forced marched to the Battle of Antietam where it was placed in line of battle but did not see any significant combat . 
The next day , the regiment pursued the Confederate army and fought in a skirmish at Williamsport . 
The 139th was transferred in October 1862 to the <Org>VI Corps</Org> . 
In the Battle of Fredericksburg , it suffered minor casualties from artillery fire , but did n't get a chance to fight . 
Five months later , however , it did participate in the 2nd Battle of Fredericksburg . 
At the Battle of Gettysburg in July , it helped defend the left flank of the Union army . 
Throughout the spring and into early summer of 1864 , the 139th fought in <Org>Grant</Org> 's Overland Campaign and the early stages of the Siege of <Location>Petersburg</Location> . 
In July , it was transferred to <Location>Washington</Location> , <Location>D.C.</Location> with the rest of the <Org>VI Corps</Org> to defeat Lt. Gen. <Person>Jubal</Person> Early 's attack on the city . 
Then they fought under <Person>Philip Sheridan</Person> in the <Location>Valley</Location> to ensure that no more Confederate armies would invade again . 
( See the article on the campaign ) . 
By December 1864 , they were back in the siege lines of <Location>Petersburg</Location> . 
The 139th supported <Person>Sheridan</Person> in the Appomattox Campaign and fought in the Battle of Sayler 's Creek . 
After the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse , it was ordered to the <Location>North Carolina</Location> border to support <Person>William T. Sherman</Person> , but the Confederate surrender there made further support unnecessary . 
The regiment was mustered out June 21 , 1865 . 
The 1896 <Location>Atlantic City</Location> rail crash occurred shortly after 6:30 pm on July 30 , 1896 at a crossing just west of <Location>Atlantic City</Location> , <Location>New Jersey</Location> , crushing five loaded passenger coaches , killing 50 and seriously injuring approximately 60 . 
A train consisting of seven cars left <Location>Atlantic City</Location> over the <Location>West Jersey</Location> <Person>Railroad</Person> bearing a special excursion of Red Men and their friends from Bridgeton and <Location>Salem</Location> , <Location>New Jersey</Location> , and had reached the crossing of the <Location>Reading</Location> Railroad when it was struck by the 5:40 down express train from <Location>Philadelphia</Location> . 
Two cars were demolished and the two following cars were telescoped . 
The engine of the <Location>Reading</Location> train was wrecked , the engineer killed , and the fireman fatally injured . 
The car behind it was thrown from the track and many of its occupants were killed or injured . 
In 1896 , leaving <Location>Atlantic City</Location> , the tracks of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> Road ran parallel to those of the <Location>Camden</Location> and <Location>Atlantic</Location> until they crossed the drawbridge , when they switched off to the south , crossing the <Location>Reading</Location> Road at an oblique angle . 
<Person>John Greiner</Person> , the engineer of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train , saw the <Location>Reading</Location> train approaching the crossing at a swift speed , but as the signals were open for him to proceed on his way , he continued . 
His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the <Location>Reading</Location> train , which left <Location>Philadelphia</Location> at 5:40 pm , struck the first car full in the centre , throwing it far off the track in a nearby ditch , and completely submerging it . 
The second car of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train was also carried into the ditch , the third and fourth cars being telescoped . 
The engine of the <Location>Reading</Location> train was thrown to the other side of the track , carrying with it the first coach . 
A few minutes after the collision , the boiler of the <Location>Reading</Location> locomotive exploded , scalding several to death and casting boiling spray over many of the injured passengers . 
As soon as the news reached <Location>Atlantic City</Location> it spread rapidly , and thousands of people flocked to the scene . 
The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages , omnibuses , bicycles , and all kinds of vehicles , while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to render what assistance they could or to satisfy their curiosity . 
Darkness fell quickly , and the work of rescuing the injured and recovering the bodies of the dead was carried out under the glare of huge bonfires . 
As onlookers watched through the night , the mangled and burned bodies of the dead were carried from the wreckage which trapped them and laid side by side on the gravel bank near the track , with no other covering than the few newspapers gathered from the passengers . 
The wounded were quickly gathered together and carried by train and wagon to the <Org>Atlantic City Hospital</Org> , where six of them died shortly after their arrival . 
Two others died within a day , with 42 having been killed at the collision scene . 
The old Excursion <Org>House</Org> at the foot of <Location>Mississippi</Location> Avenue was converted into a morgue , and the dead were taken there . 
During the first night after the crash , the streets in the vicinity of the Excursion <Org>House</Org> and the <Org>City Hospital</Org> , as well as the road leading to the scene of the accident , were packed with people anxious to learn the latest news . 
The Bridgeton and <Location>Salem</Location> excursionists who escaped injury were brought back to <Location>Atlantic City</Location> and sent home on a special train several hours later in the evening . 
<Person>James W. Hoyt</Person> , Secretary of the <Org>New Jersey Department of Public Safety</Org> , immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident , telegraphed for the <Org>Philadelphia Medical Emergency Corps</Org> , fifteen of whom responded , and hurried to <Location>Atlantic City</Location> on a special train which left <Location>Philadelphia</Location> at 10:45 pm . 
These surgeons materially aided <Location>Atlantic City</Location> 's volunteer corps , which was composed of almost every physician then living in the city . 
Many of the injured were taken to hotels , as the city hospitals soon became overcrowded . 
About thirty of the wounded had their injuries dressed and were able to proceed on their way . 
The wife of <Person>Edward Farr</Person> , the <Location>Reading</Location> engineer who died while on the job , and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake , when informed of the accident and of her husband 's death , was unable to withstand the shock , and fell to the floor dead . 
County Coroner <Person>William McLaughlin</Person> , immediately upon hearing of the accident , went to the scene . 
He went directly into the block tower and questioned operator <Person>George F. Hauser</Person>. Houser told him that he thought the excursion train had time to cross the tracks of the <Location>Reading</Location> before the express got there and he set the " clear " signal for the <Location>West Jersey</Location> train . 
( The signalling system worked as follows : the interlocking block system was used . 
There were three poles with semaphores controlled by the tower on the reading tracks and two on the <Location>West Jersey</Location> . 
The pole furthest from the tower on the <Location>Reading</Location> tracks was distant about 2,000 yards . 
The other two were much closer . 
When the operator set the " clear " signal on the <Location>Pennsylvania</Location> track , this would automatically set the " danger " signal on the <Location>Reading</Location> track , and vice versa . ) 
Before <Person>Hauser</Person> could make a further explanation to the coroner he received an order from the railroad officials to say nothing . 
He obeyed , and made no further explanation . 
Pending an investigation , <Person>Hauser</Person> was put under arrest by the coroner , but was released on $500 bond . 
A jury was impanelled the following day . 
Testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead <Location>Reading</Location> Railroad express engineer , <Person>Edward Farr</Person> . 
His action in running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour past a danger signal seemed inexplicable to those present at the inquest . 
His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of exceptionally high moral character , and not of a reckless or careless disposition . 
Only two weeks previous to the accident his train was signalled to stop at that very crossing , and he promptly brought his train under control . 
The coroner 's jury returned verdicts on August 7 . 
Six jurors merely stated the manner of the passengers ' deaths . 
Three found that " <Person>Engineer Edward</Person> D . 
<Location>Farr</Location> of the <Location>Atlantic City</Location> Railroad failed for have his engine under proper control on approaching [ the ] crossing , and that Tower Man <Person>George F. Hauser</Person> , in giving the excursion train of the <Location>West Jersey</Location> <Person>Railroad</Person> the right of way over a fast express used bad judgment. .. [ and ] that <Person>Engineer</Person> <Person>John Greiner</Person> of said excursion train erred in not exercising greater care on crossing ahead of said fast express . " 
Three others found that " the cause of the collision was the failure of <Person>Edward Farr</Person> , engineer of <Person>Train</Person> No. 23 , to give heed in time to the semaphore signals and crossing under the rules. .. the tower man , <Person>George F. Hauser</Person> , may have used poor judgment in his estimate of the distance away of the <Location>Atlantic City</Location> <Person>Railroad</Person> train when he gave the white boards to the <Location>West Jersey</Location> and Seashore Excursion <Person>Train</Person> No . 700 .

Created in 1998 by <Person>Jared Leto</Person> and his brother , <Location>Shannon</Location> , 30 Seconds to Mars began as a small family project . 
Things began to speed up quickly , and <Person>Matt Wachter</Person> later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player . 
After working with small revolving door of guitarists ( as the band 's first two guitarists , <Person>Kevin Drake</Person> and <Person>Solon Bixler</Person> , left the band due to issues primarily related to touring ) , the three auditioned Tomo MiliФeviФ to round out the band 's roster . 
According to an interview from <Org>Virgin Records</Org> , the band 's name 
30 Seconds to Mars ' first , self-titled album , produced by <Person>Bob Ezrin</Person> , was released in 2002 to mixed reviews and achieved sales of just over 100,000 . 
Their sophomore album , A Beautiful Lie , was released on August 30 , 2005 . 
For this effort , the band traveled ( during the course of three years ) to four continents , to perfect their sound and also to allow for <Person>Jared</Person> 's film career . 
The album was produced by <Person>Josh Abraham</Person> , whose producing credits also include Orgy , <Person>Velvet Revolver</Person> , and <Location>Linkin Park</Location> . 
Because A Beautiful Lie was leaked five months before its release , the band decided to include two bonus tracks : " Battle of One " ( an original song that was also set to be the album 's title track when it was first announced ) and " Hunter " ( a cover of the BjУЖrkband song ) . 
To further promote the album , the band also enclosed " golden tickets " in 12 copies , which granted their owners access to any 30 Seconds to Mars concert free of charge , along with backstage access . 
On August 31 , 2006 , the band won the MTV2 Award for " The Kill " at the <Org>MTV</Org> Video <Person>Music</Person> Awards , one of their two nominations .

They were supported on this tour by Head Automatica , The Receiving End of Sirens , Cobra Starship , and several other bands including <Org>Street Drum Corps</Org> . 
The tour was " environmentally sound " according to a 2006 interview with then-bassist <Person>Matt Wachter</Person> . 
" <Person>Jared</Person> and <Person>Shannon</Person> put together this thing called Environmentor which is illustrating ways --- alternatives --- to kind of clean up some of the mess we leave behind . 
We fueled the bus with vegetable oil , " he explains . 
On November 20 , MTV2 premiered the video for " From Yesterday " ; the video is the first American rock video ever shot in its entirety in the People 's Republic of <Location>China</Location> .

Following other commitments , they will begin working on their third album . 
Following the release of " From Yesterday " as a single , the band posted a link on their MySpace blog to vote for the next single from A Beautiful Lie . 
The choices available were " A Beautiful Lie " , " The Fantasy " , " Savior " , and " The Story " . 
Another vote was done later between the top two songs , " A Beautiful Lie " and " The Fantasy " . 
On May 2 , 2007 , the band announced that " A Beautiful Lie " had won and would be the next single . 
On August 8th , 2007 , Kerrang ! announced that 30 Seconds to Mars has been nominated for two categories of the Kerrang ! 
Awards 2007 - <Org>Best International</Org> Newcomer and Best Single - The Kill . 
On August 24th , they had only won the award for ' Best Single , ' which was The Kill . 
The other award was lost to Madina <Location>Lake</Location> . 
On November 1 , 2007 , the band won the <Org>MTV Europe</Org> <Person>Music</Person> Award for " <Location>Rock</Location> Out " , one of the two catorgories they were nominated in . 
On December 21st , 2007 , 30 Seconds to Mars won Fuse 's Best of 2007 Award . 
They beat out Korn and had amassed over 7 million votes . 
31 other bands and artists such as <Person>Justin Timberlake</Person> , <Person>Gwen Stefani</Person> , <Location>Linkin Park</Location> and Avenged Sevenfold were also included in the contest . 
The band 's <Location>phoenix</Location> logo ( which the band named " Mithra " ) bears the phrase " Provehito in Altum " , the band 's motto . 
Roughly translated from Latin , this means " Launch forth into the deep " ; but a more stylized version would be " Rocket in ( to ) High ( ness ) " . 
The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band 's debut , whereas for A Beautiful Lie , the new <Location>Trinity</Location> logo was created consisting of three skulls , along with the band 's name and motto . 
The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars , which helps in bringing friends to the shows , phoning local radio stations to request the band 's songs , putting up posters , posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online , and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band . 
It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars . 
The band made acoustic versions of songs from their second album A Beautiful Lie . 
Some of the acoustics have been included in some versions of the album , e.g. Was it a Dream ? ( Acoustic ) . 
In addition to the tracks on their two full-length releases thus far , the band has also recorded a few other tracks . 
Among these tracks are " Phase 1 : Fortification " and " Valhalla " , the latter of which was present on an early demo . 
" Phase 1 : Fortification " was released on an overseas single for " Capricorn ( A <Person>Brand New</Person> Name ) " . 
Another track featured on certain imported 30 Seconds to Mars titles is " Anarchy in <Location>Tokyo</Location> " , a song that was recorded during the process of their self-titled debut . 
" Revolution " was also recorded for the self-titled album , but was n't included because it did n't fit the theme of the album , and because of fear that listeners would take the lyrics too literally , especially after the September 11 , 2001 attacks . 
" Occam 's Razor " was also recorded , but was never included on any of the band 's releases . 
As a result , it is considered the most difficult to locate of the five unreleased tracks . 
Demo versions of songs on the band 's self-titled debut were also slightly different , along with different names . 
For example , " Fallen " was previously called " Jupiter " , and " Year Zero " was previously called " Hero " . 
Also made available are the demo versions of " Buddha for <Person>Mary</Person> " and " 93 Million Miles " ; the latter originally had lyrics referring to the band Deadsy , whose members Dr. Nner and <Person>P. Exeter</Person> <Org>Blue</Org> I provided extra instrumentation on several tracks , but the lyrics were changed after the two bands were involved in a small feud . 
During recent live shows , the band has premiered two new songs , one of which may end up on the new album : " Some Other Son " and " The Believer " , which were initially written for the self-titled album but was scrapped during recording , as well as live songs such as " Sisters of Heresy " and " Under Pressure / Pressure " ( Name of song unsure , name based on lyrics ) . 
They also have a song called " Time to Wake Up . " 
On December 11 , 2006 , the band sent their fans a " stocking stuffer " in the form of a holiday song called " <Person>Santa</Person> Through the Back Door " . 
In September 2007 , the band also recorded a cover of <Person>Kanye West</Person> 's " Stronger " for <Org>BBC Radio 1</Org> 's Live Lounge .

6PR , known as 882 6PR , commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 
6PR 's focus is on news , talk and sport , and is <Location>Perth</Location> 's only commercial talkback radio station . 
6PR is owned by <Org>Fairfax Media</Org> , an Australian media company that owns television and radio businesses throughout <Location>Australia</Location> . 
Radio in <Location>Australia</Location> was just twelve years old when 6PR commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 
6PR was founded by electrical company <Org>Nicholson</Org> 's Limited , which ran the station from a studio above its showroom in Barrack Street , <Location>Perth</Location> . 
In 1963 the Victorian <Org>Broadcasting</Org> Network purchased <Org>Nicholson</Org> 's and sold the electrical division of the organisation to Vox Adeon . 
The broadcasting business was retained and operated under the name <Org>Nicholson</Org> 's <Org>Broadcasting Service Pty</Org> Ltd . 
The operation moved from Barrack Street to 340 <Location>Hay Street</Location> just after the purchase by the <Org>VBN</Org> in 1963 . 
The 6PR studio remained at 340 <Location>Hay Street</Location> for 22 years before it was demolished to make way for the expansion of <Org>Mercedes College</Org> . 
In 1985 the station relocated to its current premises at 169 <Location>Hay Street</Location> , <Location>East Perth</Location> . 
In the station 's early days there were only four people on the payroll now there are around one hundred . 
The limited hours of broadcasting 69 years ago have gradually been increased to a 24 hour , seven day a week service . 
Throughout the sixties 6PR was consistently the top rating station in <Location>Perth</Location> but lost its dominance in 1972 . 
The image of the station changed from rock n roll to beautiful music with the " Gentle On Your Mind " promotion in 1973 . 
This boosted 6PR 's ratings to a consistent number two with a number one position on several occasions . 
In 1977 an agreement was made with the <Org>TAB</Org> by the station 's owners to broadcast races in conjunction with a personality / sport format . 
In the early eighties the station commenced a more comprehensive news and current affairs format with the introduction of regular programs by <Person>Howard Sattler</Person> , <Person>Bob Maumill</Person> and <Person>Graham Mabury</Person> , which proved extremely popular with listeners . 
In 1987 the <Org>TAB</Org> purchased 6PR to secure the future of race broadcasts in <Location>Western Australia</Location> and races were broadcast across the station during popular talkback programs . 
During the early nineties the station 's current affairs / talkback program hosted by <Person>Sattler</Person> , <Person>Maumill</Person> , <Person>Mabury</Person> , <Person>Peter Newman</Person> , <Person>Gary Carvolth</Person> and <Person>Rob Broadfield</Person> achieved considerable success in spite of the ever increasing level of racing broadcasts on the station . 
In 1994 6PR , in conjunction with the <Org>TAB</Org> , was able to secure a special narrowcast broadcast license which allowed racing broadcasts to be moved from 6PR to the narrowcast broadcaster called <Org>Racing Radio</Org> . 
This move allowed 6PR to serve its two distinct audiences , those who listened purely for a talkback / news / current affairs format and those who listened just for racing information , in a more comprehensive manner . 
In December 1994 6PR was purchased by its current owner <Location>Southern Cross</Location> <Org>Broadcasting</Org> which also owned <Location>Melbourne</Location> 's number one rating talk station 3AW and television stations in <Location>Adelaide</Location> , <Location>Canberra</Location> and other places . 
During the nineties 6PR continued its dominance in the talk format arena with personalities such as <Org>David Christison & Lee Tate</Org> , <Person>Howard Sattler</Person> , <Org>Jenny Seaton & Gary Carvolth</Org> , <Person>Liam Bartlett</Person> , <Person>Harvey Deegan</Person> and <Person>Graham Mabury</Person> .

<Person>Agnieszka Lipska Baranowska</Person> ( 1819 - 1890 ) was a Polish playwright and poet . 
Born on April 16 , 1819 in GostkУГcity near ХФczyca in a Polish szlachta family of Lipscy to <Person>Jacob Lipski</Person> and Marjania Zaluska , she spent her life in the Prussian partition , including the <Org>Grand</Org> Duchy of PoznaХ . 
She had one brother , Konstanty , who died when she was six . 
She was married in 1838 to <Person>Stanislaw Baranowski</Person> ( 1806-1843 ) , who was an officer in the Polish forces during the January Uprising . 
After her husband 's death in 1843 , while she was pregnant with their daughter Stanislawa , she became the head of the family at the age of 24 , and took care of their lands in Marszew . 
She had many friends and colleagues among the Polish writers of the Great Emigration , some of whom visited her manor in Marszew . 
They included <Person>Karol BaliХ</Person>ski , Teofil Lenartowicz , Franciszek <Person>Mickiewicz</Person> and Eweryst Estkowski .

She wrote several plays for the local theater in Pleszew , likely inspired by and with the encouragement of <Person>Stanislaw Sczaniecki</Person> from Karmin . 
She also wrote many poems , some of which she dedicated to the great Polish poet <Person>Adam Mickiewicz</Person> . 
Most of her works were dedicated to rekindling the patriotic spirit of <Location>Poles</Location> , and used many elements from myths and legends of Greater <Location>Poland</Location> . 
Some of them were printed in the women 's press ( " Lechu " , " Dwutygodniku dla Kobiet " ) . 
She died on December 15 , 1890 in PoznaХ . 
Agotes or Cagots were a discriminated minority in the Navarrese <Location>Pyrenees</Location> , Basque provinces , Bearn , Gascony and also Brittany . 
They have been also known by other names : Cagots , Gahets , Gafets in <Location>France</Location> ; Agotes , Gafos in <Location>Spain</Location> ; and Cacons , Cahets , Caqueux and Caquins in <Location>Brittany</Location> . 
The earliest mention of them is in 1288 , when they appear to have been called Christiens or Christianos . 
During the Middle Ages they were popularly looked upon as cretins , lepers , heretics and even as cannibals . 
They were shunned and hated ; were allotted separate quarters in towns , called cagoteries , and lived in wretched huts in the country distinct from the villages . 
Excluded from all political and social rights , they were only allowed to enter a church by a special door , and during the service a rail separated them from the other worshippers . 
Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament , or the Eucharist was handed to them on the end of a stick , while a receptacle for holy water was reserved for their exclusive use . 
They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress , to which , in some places , was attached the foot of a goose or duck ( whence they were sometimes called Canards ) . 
And so pestilential was their touch considered that it was a crime for them to walk the common road barefooted . 
The only trades allowed them were those of butcher and carpenter , and their ordinary occupation was wood-cutting . 
The origin of Agotes ( or Cagots ) is uncertain . 
It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths , and somebody derives the name from caas ( dog ) and Goth . 
But opposed to this etymology is the fact that the word " cagot " is first found in this form no earlier than 1551 . 
French historian <Location>Pierre</Location> de Marca ( 16th century ) , in his Histoire de Beam , holds that the word signifies hunters of the Goths , and that the Cagots are descendants of the Saracens . 
Others made them descendants of the Albigenses . 
A far more probable explanation of their name Christians is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as pauperes Christi , and that , Goths or not , these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it . 
Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins . 
It was not until the French Revolution that any steps were taken to ameliorate their lot , but today they no longer form a class and have been practically lost sight of in the general peasantry .

The <Org>Amateur Hockey Association of Canada</Org> ( AHAC ) was an amateur men 's ice hockey league founded in 1886 , in existence until 1898 . 
It was the second ice hockey league organized in <Location>Canada</Location> , after one in <Location>Kingston</Location> , <Location>Ontario</Location> started in 1883 . 
It was organized to provide a longer season to determine the Canadian champion . 
Prior to its founding the Canadian championship was determined in a tournament in <Location>Montreal</Location> . 
The 1893 champion of the league , <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> was the first winner of the <Person>Stanley Cup</Person> , being awarded the <Person>Cup</Person> as the champions of the AHAC and the AHAC was considered the top league of <Location>Canada</Location> . 
of various hockey clubs met at the <Person>Victoria Skating</Person> Rink in <Location>Montreal</Location> at the instigation of the <Org>Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal</Org> . 
They agreed that the season should run from the 1st of January until the 15th of March . 
The constitution would be adapted from a lacrosse league constitution . 
The teams knew each other . 
<Person>Mr . Thomas D</Person> . Green of <Location>Ottawa</Location> had played on the 1883 McGill hockey team . 
In that age , ice hockey was a very different game compared to today : the AHAC rules stated that there were six skaters on each side . 
The left wing , centre and right wing were the forwards , like today . 
The rover would line up behind the centre , with the point and coverpoint following , in an ' I ' formation towards the goaltender . 
The face offs were at a right angle to today 's practice , the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink . 
The goaltenders used no special equipment . 
There were no goal nets . 
The goals were two posts , with no crossbar . 
An umpire would judge the legality of each score . 
There were no boards along the sides of the ice , and there were no standard dimensions for a rink , although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink . 
A match was two halves of thirty minutes ( also to note that in the day , game meant goal by modern definition ) . 
Sudden-death overtime was also in place , and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation . 
Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes . 
The AHAC operated on two different systems in its lifetime : the challenge system , where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship , and the series system , which corresponds to the regular season found in the <Org>NHL</Org> today . 
With the exception of 1888 , the challenge system was exclusively used in the AHAC before the advent of the <Person>Stanley Cup</Person> , while the series system became the norm in 1893 , the first year the <Person>Cup</Person> was contested . 
The first championship team of the AHAC was the <Location>Montreal</Location> Crystals , having unofficially being declared the champions before the AHAC . 
The first title change occurred on January 14 , 1887 , when the <Location>Montreal</Location> Victorias defeated the champions 4-0 . 
The Victorias would hold the title until the very last challenge game , when the Crystals won 3-2 in their third successive challenge . 
Because of the Vics ' long run as champions , it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888 . 
The series system was a success , although a tie atop the standings between the Vics and the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club ( Montreal</Org> <Org>HC</Org> ) , and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two Victorias players were injured , at the home venue of the <Location>Montreal</Location> <Org>HC</Org> . 
However , teams from outside <Location>Montreal</Location> incurred huge travelling expenses , which led the AHAC to revert back to the challenge system . 
In 1893 , the first year since 1888 where the AHAC played under a series system , the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> lost their first game against the <Org>Ottawa Hockey Club</Org> , and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship . 
<Person>Lord Stanley</Person> announced that his challenge trophy ( later known simply as the <Person>Stanley Cup</Person> ) for the best amateur hockey team in <Location>Canada</Location> would be presented to the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> on May 15 , 1893 , as initial champion . 
At the time , the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> was in a dispute with its parent organization , the <Org>Montreal Amateur Athletic Association</Org> ( <Org>MAAA</Org> ) . 
The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy , while the directors of the <Org>MAAA</Org> decided to accept the trophy , considering it came from the Governor General of <Location>Canada</Location> . 
Thus , the trophy was accepted by the <Org>MAAA</Org> , but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present . 
After accepting the trophy , the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them . 
In the end , the <Org>MAAA</Org> investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy , even though such an action would damage the reputation of the <Org>MAAA</Org> . 
It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were , in fact , not representative of the team itself , and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season , it was flatly refused ( the first time the <Org>MAAA</Org> refused anything to the hockey club ) . 
Inexplicably , the hockey club reversed its position , and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the <Org>MAAA</Org> and the club . 
Indeed , the inscriptions on the <Person>Cup</Person> when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated " <Location>Montreal</Location> <Org>HC</Org> " . 
The <Org>MAAA</Org> , at one point , considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them . 
The issue would be finally resolved in later years , after various attempts at reconciliation . 
<Person>Stanley Cup</Person> winner 
According to <Person>Arthur Farrell</Person> 's book of 1899 , " Hockey : <Location>Canada</Location> 's <Org>Royal Winter Game</Org> " , <Location>Montreal</Location> Crystals are recorded as champions in 1887 , and the <Org>Montreal Hockey Club</Org> is recorded as the winner from 1888-1894 . 
See reference copy on Backcheck . 
According to Ultimate Hockey , the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series . 
The final champion at the end of the season 's worth of challenges would be considered ' <Org>Dominion</Org> of <Location>Canada</Location> ' champion .

<Person>Angela Carder</Person> ( nУЉe <Location>Stone</Location> ) was an American cancer patient who , in 1987 , was forced to undergo a life-threatening Caesarean section in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her fetus . 
The case stands as a landmark in <Location>United States</Location> case law establishing the rights of pregnant women to determine their own health care . 
At age thirteen , <Person>Angela Stoner</Person> was diagnosed with a rare and usually fatal form of cancer . 
She survived , and after years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was declared to be in remission . 
Ten years after the initial diagnosis she developed another form of cancer , which she and her doctors fought with equal determination . 
The second cancer went into remission . 
<Person>Angela</Person> later married and became pregnant . 
In 1987 , when <Person>Carder</Person> was twenty-five weeks pregnant , her cancer was discovered to have recurred and metastasized to her lung . 
Exactly what plan she made on learning this is unclear : one source claims that she was determined to prolong her life , and elected to start radiation and chemotherapy , regardless of known risks to the fetus ; others state that she chose to institute only palliative care , in an effort to remain alive until the 28th week of gestation , when it was thought the fetus would have a better chance of survival . 
Whatever her choice , the administrators of <Org>George Washington University Hospital</Org> -- who were also the liability risk managers -- were disturbed to hear that she had not elected to have an immediate <Org>C-</Org>section procedure . 
Fearing a lawsuit by pro-life activists , they convened a court hearing at the hospital and obtained separate counsels for <Person>Carder</Person> , her fetus , and the hospital . 
At the hearing , family members , including <Person>Carder</Person> 's husband , opposed the <Org>C-</Org>section on the grounds that she would be unlikely to survive it and that she would not want it ( <Person>Carder</Person> herself , now gravely ill , did not testify ) . 
Her treating physicians also opposed the procedure . 
However , a neonatologist not personally familiar with her medical status testified that the fetus would have at least a 60% chance of survival -- nearly that of a healthy woman 's fetus at the same gestational age . 
<Person>Carder</Person> 's own long-term oncologist was not contacted ; he has since stated that he would have called the procedure " medically inadvisable both for <Person>Angela Carder</Person> and for the fetus " . 
Nonetheless , and despite medical testimony that such a procedure would probably end <Person>Carder</Person> 's life , an order was issued authorizing the hospital to perform an immediate <Org>C-</Org>section . 
<Org>Obstetricians</Org> at the hospital initially refused to carry out the procedure , but eventually one reluctantly agreed . 
A three-judge appellate panel upheld the decision in an emergency telephone appeal , despite <Person>Carder</Person> 's own repeated pleas of " I do n't want it done . " 
Exactly how long the fetus survived is a matter of some dispute . 
The most commonly cited figure is two hours . 
<Person>Susan Faludi</Person> quotes the obstetrician who performed the surgery as saying attempts to inflate the fetus 's lungs were " like trying to ventilate a rock " . 
<Person>Angela Carder</Person> survived her surgery by two days . 
In the wake of the surgery , <Person>Carder</Person> 's family and the <Org>American Civil Liberties Union</Org> 's <Org>Reproductive Freedom Project</Org> asked the <Org>D.C. Court of Appeals</Org> to vacate the order and its legal precedent , on grounds that the order had violated <Person>Carder</Person> 's right to informed consent and her constitutional rights of privacy and bodily integrity . 
One hundred twenty organizations filed amicus briefs on <Person>Carder</Person> 's behalf , including the <Org>American Medical Association</Org> and the <Org>American College of Obstetricians</Org> and <Org>Gynecologists</Org> . 
One attorney for the hospital argued that it was appropriate to sacrifice a dying woman for her fetus ; an appeals court judge is reported to have replied , " Are you urging this court to find that you can handcuff a woman to a bed and force her to give birth ? " 
On April 26 , 1990 , the court issued the ruling In re A.C. , which vacated the previous decisions and ruled that <Person>Angela Carder</Person> had the right to make health-care decisions for herself and her fetus . 
At the same time as the Court of Appeals case , the <Org>ACLU</Org> and <Person>Carder</Person> 's parents , <Person>Daniel</Person> and <Person>Nettie</Person> <Person>Stoner</Person> , instituted a civil action , Stoners v. <Org>George Washington University Hospital</Org> , et al. , suing the hospital for deprivation of human rights , discrimination , wrongful death and malpractice , among other charges . 
In November of 1990 , days before the scheduled trial was to begin , the hospital settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and a promise of new hospital policies protecting the rights of pregnant women .

A Portuguesa is the national anthem of <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
It was written by Henrique Lopes de MendonУЇa ( lyrics ) and <Person>Alfredo Keil</Person> ( music ) after the nationalist resurgence provoked by the British Ultimatum ( for Portuguese troops to vacate the territory between <Location>Angola</Location> and <Location>Mozambique</Location> ) , was adopted as a <Org>Republican</Org> anthem and , finally , by the new <Location>Portuguese Republic</Location> in 1910 as the national anthem , replacing " <Person>O Hymno</Person> da Carta " , the last anthem of the Constitutional Monarchy in <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
The title A Portuguesa means " the Portuguese ( song ) " --- the Portuguese word for " song " , canУЇУЃo , being feminine --- just as <Org>La</Org> Marseillaise , the national anthem of <Location>France</Location> , is " the song of <Location>Marseille</Location> " , the Belgian anthem , The BrabanУЇonne is " the song of <Location>Brabant</Location> " , and L'Internationale , the Socialist anthem , is " the international ( song ) " . 
In 1890 , the <Location>United Kingdom</Location> issued an ultimatum demanding <Location>Portugal</Location> give up its intentions of occupying the land between the African colonies of <Location>Angola</Location> , on the western coast , and <Location>Mozambique</Location> , on the eastern coast , thus joining the two territories . 
Despite popular uproar , the government was forced to accept the British terms , a measure that contributed to the growing unpopularity of King <Person>Carlos</Person> I and the monarchy and gained supporters for the already boosting republican movement . 
Inspired by the common feeling of outrage among the people , writer Henrique Lopes de MendonУЇa composed a poem urging his compatriots to " fight for the fatherland " ( Pela PУЁtri luta ) and praising the country 's past as a naval power , particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries . 
The words were set to a melody by composer <Person>Alfredo Keil</Person> and the song soon became popular among people unhappy with what they considered a submissive and humiliating attitude by the Portuguese authorities . 
On January 31 , 1891 , a republican revolution broke out in the northern city of <Location>Porto</Location> and " A Portuguesa " was adopted by the rebels as their anthem . 
The revolution was crushed and the song banned . 
In 1910 , on October 5 , a new revolution succeeded in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic in <Location>Portugal</Location> . 
In the following year , 1911 , a law officialized the status of " A Portuguesa " as <Location>Portugal</Location> 's national anthem . 
The song consists of the first stanza from MendonУЇa 's poem followed by a chorus . 
The second and third verses below were part of the poem , but are not included in the anthem ( and are indeed unknown to even exist by a large majority of Portuguese ) . 
The fifth line of the chorus : " Contra os canhУЕes marchar , marchar " ( Against the cannons march , march ! ) is an alteration of the original " Contra os bretУЕes marchar , marchar " ( Against the Britos march , march ! ) , a reference to the Pink Map . 
Armistice Day is the anniversary of the official end of <Org>World</Org> War I , November 11 , 1918 . 
It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and <Location>Germany</Location> at CompiУЈgn , Franc , for the cessation of hostilities on the <Location>Western Front</Location> , which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning --- the " eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month . " 
While this official date to mark the end of the war reflects the ceasefire on the <Location>Western Front</Location> , hostilities continued in other regions , especially across the former Russian <Person>Empire</Person> and in parts of the old <Person>Ottoman Empire</Person> . 
The date was a national holiday in many of the former allied nations to allow people to commemorate those members of the armed forces who were killed during war . 
After <Org>World</Org> War II , it was changed to Veterans Day in the <Location>United States</Location> and to Remembrance Day in the British <Org>Commonwealth</Org> of Nations . 
Armistice Day is an official holiday in <Location>France</Location> . 
It is also an official holiday in <Location>Belgium</Location> , known also as the day of peace in the Flanders Fields . 
In many parts of the world , people take two minutes of silence at 11:00 in the morning as a sign of respect for the roughly eight million who died in the war , as suggested by <Person>Edward George Honey</Person> in a letter to a British newspaper though Wellesley <Person>Tudor Pole</Person> established two ceremonial periods of remembrance based on events in 1917 . 
Beginning in 1939 , the two-minute silence was moved to the Sunday nearest the 11th , in order not to interfere with wartime production should the 11th fall on a weekday . 
Since the 1990s a growing number of people have observed a two-minute silence on 11 November , resulting in both Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday being commemorated formally in the <Location>UK</Location> ( although in 2007 they fell on the same day ) . 
November 11th 2008 will be the 90th anniversary of Armistice Day .

The <Org>Australian</Org> <Person>League</Person> of Rights is a minor political organisation in <Location>Australia</Location> founded by <Person>Eric Butler</Person> with its basis in the economic theory of Social Credit expounded by <Person>C. H. Douglas</Person> . 
It describes itself as upholding the virtues of freedom . 
It is not a political party , but rather sees itself as a watchdog against government intervention . 
The <Person>League</Person> was formed in 1960 by a merger of various Leagues of Rights based in the Australian states , the first of which was based in <Location>South Australia</Location> from 1946 . 
The <Person>League</Person> 's founder <Person>Eric Butler</Person> died on June 9 2006 , at the age of 90 . 
The <Person>League</Person> , like many other far-Right organisations , strongly denies that the Holocaust , during which millions of people , particularly European Jews , were killed , ever occurred . 
It is strongly supportive of the polemicist and Holocaust denial advocate <Person>David Irving</Person> . 
They believe that the world is run by a secret society of Jews . 
The <Person>League</Person> is distinctive for asserting that The Protocols of the <Org>Elders</Org> of Zion is a genuine Jewish document ( the EncyclopУІdi Britannica for example describes the Protocols as a " fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century " ) . 
The <Person>League</Person> describes itself as being based on the principles of Christianity and is vehement in its anti-communism . 
They argue in favour of capitalism by promoting the sanctity of private property and individual enterprise . 
They are keen promoters of Social Credit . 
They are strongly monarchist and completely opposed to Australian republicanism and see the links to <Location>Great Britain</Location> as being fundamental to Australian identity . 
The <Person>League</Person> has been accused of being associated with the now-defunct <Org>Australian National Socialist Party</Org> . 
Former <Location>Western Australian</Location> Labor MP , founder of the <Org>Australia First Party</Org> and later One Nation member <Person>Graeme Campbell</Person> was associated with the <Person>League</Person> at the same time as he was a member of One Nation and <Location>Australia</Location> First . 
<Person>Mr Campbell</Person> stated that " <Location>Australia</Location> First has no association with the <Person>League</Person> . 
It 's me with the association . " 
Former treasurer <Person>Peter Costello</Person> stated that One Nation 's policy of a state bank which would issue low-interest loans was directly taken from the ALOR , and that " the <Person>League</Person> of Rights is driving its policy in relation to banking and money " 
The Australian branch of the B'nai B'rith <Org>Anti-Defamation Commission</Org> issued a press release that " The Co-founder of Australians Against Further Immigration ( AAFI ) , and One Nation 's Victorian leader <Person>Robyn Spencer</Person> has addressed numerous <Person>League</Person> of Rights meetings as well as delivered a speech with <Person>League</Person> of Rights , <Org>Advisory National</Org> Director <Person>Eric Butler</Person> . " 
ALOR is also allegedly associated with National <Person>Action</Person> 
In the 1970s and early 1980s , the <Person>League</Person> attempted to gain control of the <Org>National Party of Australia</Org> , encouraging members to join the party in sufficient numbers to take control , a tactic known as entryism . 
<Person>Doug Anthony</Person> led an effort to defend the Party from the <Person>League</Person> by recruiting people who would vote against them . 
After a long struggle over several years , the existing leadership prevailed . 
A surprising consequence of this struggle was that the <Org>National Party</Org> , which got far fewer votes than either the Labor or <Org>Liberal</Org> parties , had more members . 
This fact became much more widely known than the reason for it , with both sides keeping the struggle out of the media . 
It has been associated with the now-defunct <Location>New Zealand</Location> <Person>League</Person> of Rights , the Canadian <Person>League</Person> of Rights and through the British <Person>League</Person> of Rights also the <Org>John Birch Society</Org> in the <Location>United States</Location> . 
Critics have pointed to the past participation of the <Person>League</Person> in the former <Org>World</Org> <Org>Anti-</Org>Communist <Person>League</Person> alongside dictatorial regimes like that of Augusto Pinochet .

The Ayalon Cave is a large underground limestone cave located near <Person>Ramla</Person> , <Location>Israel</Location> . 
The cave , 300 feet deep , with its branch extends almost 2.5 kilometres making it the second largest limestone cave in <Location>Israel</Location> . 
Researchers announced that they have so far discovered eight new species , all without eyes , including four crustacean species and four terrestrial species , previously unknown to science . 
They added that the crustaceans included two saltwater species and two freshwater species , indicating that this diversity might help better understand the water history of the region . 
The cave was first discovered when a small opening was discerned in a quarry near <Person>Ramla</Person> . 
According to Professor <Person>Amos Frumkin</Person> of the <Org>Hebrew University</Org> , the cave is unique in that a thick layer of chalk left it impermeable to water . 
The cave will remain closed to the public to allow scientific investigation to continue undisturbed . 
As the cave was completely cut off from the outside environment , it sustained an independent ecosystem ; this ecosystem did not rely on sunlight and photosynthesis , or on organic compounds , for an energy source . 
Rather , energy was extracted by Chemoautotrophic bacteria , living in a film on top of the pool water . 
These bacteria produce energy by oxidizing the sulfide compounds in the water , and derive organic compounds using carbon dioxide from the air . 
These compounds form the basis of the cave 's ecosystem .

The French found the enemy assembled on the field , while women and children had already retired themselves in a small thick and almost impenetrable bush where the Azna defended themselves when facing a <Location>superior</Location> enemy . 
After the Azna had started to sisperse under the French gunfire , their lines broke when hit by three grapeshot balls ; the Azna then retreated in the bush , where the thick foliage partly protected the natives from the gunfire . 
The French felt that if left there , the Azna may attack them at night ; so it was decideed to assault the bush , but being careful to leave a way of escape for the Azna open , so to avoid a too deadly confrontation that could cost too much blood . 
The French met a strong resistance , killing 2 riflemen and wounding 4 , but were at the end successful and forced the Azna to escape . 
The battle had protracted itself till 13:00 , and among the French tirailleurs 4 were killed and 6 wounded , with 7,000 cartridges consummed . 
The Battle of Vilcapugio was fought on October 1 , 1813 during the Campaign of Alto <Location>Peru</Location> in the Argentine War of Independence , where the pro-independence forces led by General <Person>Manuel Belgrano</Person> were defeated by the pro-Spanish Realists , led by <Person>Joaquin</Person> de la Pazuela . 
The Campaign was restarted upon the insistence of the government in <Location>Buenos Aires</Location> after the <Org>Army</Org> of the North 's victories during the Battles of TucumУЁn and Salta . 
Despite having malaria and having to command a company of new conscripts with insufficient artillery , <Person>Belgrano</Person> accepted the commanding post . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army was supported by Colonel Baltasar CУЁrdenas and the 2,000 poorly organized natives under his command , and Colonel Cornelio Zelaya with forces from <Location>Cochabamba</Location> . 
Both colonels had orders to incite rebellion amongst the indigenous populations who provided the realists with valuable information . 
Knowing that the realist army did not have enough mules to move its artillery and provisions , <Person>Belgrano</Person> planned to use a pincer movement to attack , confidently believing that Pezuela would not provide much resistance . 
At the end of September 1813 , most of <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army arrived in the prairie of Vilcapugio , which was a plateau surrounded by tall mountains to the north of PotosУ­ . 
The realist troops were encamped at Condo-Condo under the orders of Pazuela and Major Saturnino Castro , which allowed them to cut off CУЁrdenas ' troops and any communication between <Person>Belgrano</Person> and the Cochabamban forces . 
Castro also attained documents from CУЁrdenas giving instructions to <Person>Belgrano</Person> . 
With these documents Pazuela was able to interrupt <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's plans and began his advance on the mountains on October 1 . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> 's army veterans from the North contained the left flank and center column of the realist army and forced them to back down until Pezuela recognized he was losing the battle at Virrey de <Location>Lima</Location> ; however , his own left flank remained in action and defeated <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's right column . 
The realist army reorganized itself and appropriated all of its artillery , continuously shelling the few soldiers left in <Person>Belgrano</Person> 's encampment . 
<Person>Belgrano</Person> and Eustaquio DУ­az VУЉlez had decided that Vel would be the one to go to PotosУ­ to reunite with the dispersed troops . 
DУ­az VУЉlez took command over the troops in PotosУ­ after Vilcapugio with the rest of the army on the left flank of the enemy . 
At this point the troops organized themselves to pursue the Campaign of Alto PerУК according the orders of the government of <Location>Buenos Aires</Location> .

<Person>Ben Player Ben</Person> is the current 2007 <Org>World</Org> Champion . 
He is known for his flawless bodyboarding style and massive charging . 
His victory came after placing second ( narrowly being defeated by <Person>Damian King</Person> ) in the 2006 Pipeline final . 
He has finished # 2 overall on the world bodyboarding tour several times . 
<Person>Ben</Person> now also helps run <Org>Movement Bodyboarding Magazine</Org> . 
The <Location>Shark Island</Location> Challenge is <Location>Australia</Location> 's richest bodyboarding competition , bankrolled to the tune of $120,000 . 
But as they say , money ca n't buy love -- or , as was the case in July 2005 , wave action . 
When the month-long waiting period ran out without a hint of swell , organisers were forced to put the outcome in the hands of competitors . 
And so the first stop on the <Org>World</Org> <Person>Bodyboarding</Person> <Person>Tour</Person> would be decided by a vote : either split the prize money and the championship points evenly between all competitors , or run the comp in the puny swell benignly flopping over a rock ledge usually famous for its forbidding risk to life and limb . 
" I just thought , ' You fools , this is what we do ' , " says <Person>Ben Player</Person> , one of only two pro riders who voted to compete . 
At 28 , he sensed his chances of ever winning a world title receding with each hand raised in opposition : he had fancied his chances at the infamous Island . 
Retreating to his car , he broke down and cried , angered and frustrated by his <Person>peers</Person> ' reluctance to man up at a spot that has always rewarded the brave . 
He paddled out anyway , an overt display of defiance against the group 's decision - albeit a failed one . 
" I ended up cutting my hand pretty badly on the reef . 
It was n't rideable at all ... " 
Six months later he was in <Location>Hawaii</Location> in January 06 for the final stop on the world tour . 
The irony of that frigid afternoon in Cronulla did n't <Person>dawn</Person> on Player as he paddled out in flawless , two-metre waves for the final of the Pipeline Pro ; he was too preoccupied with matters at hand . 
After further tour stops in <Location>Chile</Location> , <Location>Portugal</Location> and Maui , the two riders left in the hunt for the 2006 crown were the same pair who had voted in favour of going ahead at <Location>Shark Island</Location> - <Person>Ben Player</Person> and Queenslander <Person>Mitchell Rawlins</Person> . 
With <Person>Rawlins</Person> knocked out in the quarters , <Person>Ben</Person> needed to place at least second in the final to realise his dream of becoming world champ . 
His surfing in that 30-minute final was truly world class , combining clean barrels with solid boosts . 
<Person>Ben</Person> opened up a lead early that he would hold on to through to the siren . 
Not just the master of Pipeline , but champion of the world ... 
Then , further controversy . 
In the hazy , backlit conditions of the late afternoon , it was revealed that the judges had confused the riders , awarding Player the points for a ride his opponent had made . 
Scores were hastily revised , then the gutting news : Player had been relegated to runner-up , just moments before he was due to be presented with the Pipeline trophy . 
The confusion soured the occasion . 
But <Person>Ben Player</Person> was bodyboarding 's newest world champion . 
This month Player returns to <Location>Hawaii</Location> to defend his title . 
No such contest debacles this year , which means <Person>Ben Player</Person> is more ambitious than ever to win it clean . 
And again it will all come down to Pipeline , where his performances every winter since he first arrived as a wiry 16-year-old have made him a stand out , no matter what surfcraft you favour , as even the greatest surfer on the planet will attest . 
" <Person>Ben</Person> gets a fair share of respect from the crew there , " says <Person>Kelly Slater</Person> . 
" He does n't really say all that much but seems to get the job done right . 
He has a good eye for how to ride a wave . 
A great surfer is a great surfer , no matter what they ride . " 
That wiry frame has filled out during the 13 seasons he 's spent hassling for waves amongst the hungry pack of board riders who converge on the famous stretch of sand every northern winter . 
He shares physical traits with his brother <Person>Toby</Person> , also a pro bodyboarder and half the reason why the name Player has been tattooed on everything bodyboarding since the sport 's boom days of the mid-1990s . 
" You ca n't help but be competitive with your brother , " <Person>Ben</Person> says of their early years riding the wedging peaks of <Location>Whale Beach</Location> , on <Location>Sydney</Location> 's northern beaches . 
As the younger sibling , <Person>Ben</Person> was constantly surfing with guys his senior , something he feels refined his talent and drive . 
" The fact <Person>Toby</Person> was more popular than me just made me even more competitive . " 
In fact <Person>Ben Player</Person> 's biography reflects the twists and turns of the phenomenal growth of this comparatively new sport . 
Player won Australian titles as a cadet ( under-16s ) and as a pro in 2000 , part of the new generation that reshaped bodyboarding in <Location>Australia</Location> . 
This crew put new emphasis on style and fluidity in big moves and heavy situations , keeping their bodies and legs tight and in control through monstrous airs , milking power out of the pocket of the wave -- the bowl that forms in front of the barrelling section . 
His progressive riding and surfer-good looks made him the complete package , but at 24 , when he might have been cashing in , his seat at the head of bodyboarding 's table was kicked out from under him . 
At the start of the new millennium , surf brands began pulling out of bodyboarding . 
" Three years ago I lost both sponsors on the same day . 
[ Surfwear label ] Quiksilver totally pulled out of bodyboarding and the company distributing <Person>Morey</Person> boards went bankrupt , so of course my contract went bust . 
Basically I lost $85,000 for that year and $35,000 that was owed to me , " says Player . 
Player pinpoints <Person>Mike Stewart</Person> -- the undisputed guru of bodyboarding who had pioneered the sport -- for kick-starting an era of self-reliance and self-belief , backed by his call to " support those who support bodyboarding " . 
A kind of evangelistic patriotism swept through the sport . 
First came the launch of bodyboard-specific clothing brands , then wetsuits and accessories . 
Now bodyboarding specific stores have opened to cater for the newly independent industry . 
" The sport is in a much better position now , " Player will tell you . 
" It 's still growing , but with the money remaining in bodyboarding . " 
The thought of quitting never entered his head . 
" It was more a question of ' How am I going to make ends meet ? " 
He 'd always harboured a creative streak , was an avid scribe within the sport and a self-taught graphic designer ... The answer seems obvious now : Player pooled the last of his savings with a couple of friends and launched a magazine . 
" The only other bodyboarding magazine on the market was aimed at a young teenage audience , and here I was 20-something and I could n't relate . 
I wanted to make something I could show people and say , ' Hey , this is what I do . ' " 
For the first two years Player sold advertising for the mag , which was named <Org>Movement</Org> . 
It now employs four people ( yes , including this author ) . 
Player 's been able to step away from the day-to-day business , but the magazine is a venture that will keep him firmly rooted in the sport . 
It has even re-energised his passion for the sport . 
" The more I worked on <Org>Movement</Org> the more stoked I became on bodyboarding again . " 
As the street cred of bodyboarding evolved , so did the dynamics of the sport . 
Bodyboarders now seek out the sort of aquatic slabs breaking in shallow water that stand-up surfers leave alone . 
" On a bodyboard you can handle much steeper situations . 
Being prone means you can ride over very shallow , ledging reefs , sometimes just inches deep , where you wo n't get knocked off by steps in the wave . " 
This extreme element comes with heavy consequences . 
During a contest in <Location>Tahiti</Location> a few years ago , Player pulled into a barrel that shut down on him . 
When he finally came up for air , he was bleeding from both ears from the sheer pressure exerted by the imploding wave . 
" I think surfing actually embraces bodyboarding much more now , because it 's not really seen as competition -- we 're something totally different , " he says . 
" We 're surfing our own waves and we 've got our own industry . " 
The revamped world tour now showcases the sport at surf breaks that suit the craft . 
<Location>Shark Island</Location> is one of the best examples of this , the shallow rock bottom creating a warping barrel with an ideal end section which allows them to launch into aerial manoeuvres . 
The contest site in <Location>Chile</Location> is similar , though a true peak that barrels both ways . 
Then there is <Location>Hawaii</Location> 's Pipeline , the ideal of perfection whether you 're standing up or lying down . 
<Location>Portugal</Location> is the exception on the tour , a playful beach break , but it retains its status on the tour due to the carnival atmosphere that the sport attracts in <Location>Europe</Location> , as well as in <Location>South America</Location> . 
In <Location>Australia</Location> , the majority of top pros tend to remain nameless outside the sport 's domain ; in <Location>Europe</Location> they are feted like rock gods , mobbed by adoring fans wherever they go . 
The organisers of the world tour -- now chaired by <Person>Mr Bodyboarding</Person> himself , <Person>Mike Stewart</Person> -- say they are n't done yet with their expansion , but they 're certainly got the sport on its feet ... so to speak . 
But for now the eyes of the bodyboarding world are again squinting out towards the chunk of lava that lies submerged off the <Location>North Shore</Location> of Oahu . 
Mixed results on tour this year have <Person>Ben Player</Person> trailing on points in the race for the championship title , but he 's been in <Location>Hawaii</Location> for two months honing his act in preparation for his world title defence in mid-to-late January . 
If the waves stay away and the top pros had to vote their champion in , you could count on Player power winning the day .

Johnsbury , <Location>Vermont</Location> , near the town of <Location>Hiram</Location> on the <Location>Saco River</Location> . 
B&<Org>SR</Org> design was based on experience of the <Location>Sandy River</Location> <Person>Railroad</Person> . 
Hinkley Locomotive Works modified their 2-foot gauge Forney design to run boiler first with an extended frame similar to that installed on <Person>Sandy River Railroad</Person> # 1 following a wreck in early 1882 . 
The successful design of the <Person>Bridgton</Person> Hinkleys was subsequently repeated for the Monson <Person>Railroad</Person> and the <Person>Franklin</Person> and Megantic <Person>Railway</Person> . 
Construction began in 1882 , and trains were running to <Person>Bridgton</Person> by early 1883 . 
B&<Org>SR</Org> used early profits to replace wooden trestles with earthen fills . 
A 14-foot granite masonry arch was constructed over Hancock <Location>Brook</Location> in 1895 . track was extended to <Person>Harrison</Person> with 35 # steel rails in 1898 . 
Trestles on the <Person>Harrison</Person> extension had been replaced by earthen fills and plate girder bridges by 1906 . 
Original Hinkley locomotives # 1-2 were replaced by # 5-6 of an improved design with pilot wheels . 
B&<Org>SR</Org> then replaced the original 30 # steel rails from <Person>Bridgton</Person> Junction to <Person>Bridgton</Person> with 48 # and 50 # steel rails from 1907 to 1910 before <Location>Maine</Location> <Location>Central Railroad</Location> secured control of the B&<Org>SR</Org> in 1912 . 
Under <Location>Maine</Location> Central operation , there were 4 mixed train round trips daily from <Person>Harrison</Person> to <Person>Bridgton</Person> Junction and return . 
The first left <Person>Harrison</Person> at 5:15 AM and the last returned to <Person>Harrison</Person> at 8:45 PM . 
Train speed seldom exceeded 20 miles per hour . 
Two passenger train sets were required for this service . 
The first consisted of baggage # 10 , RPO # 25 , and one or two coaches . 
A couple of bench seats at one end of baggage-RPO # 11 provided smoking accommodation for the second train set . 
Freight traffic in 1913 was 18% outbound lumber , 15% outbound pulpwood , 15% inbound coal , 11% outbound apples and canned corn , 11% manufactured goods , 10% feed & grain , 10% express , and 2% inbound petroleum products . 
Locomotive # 8 was the last locomotive built for the <Location>Maine</Location> 2-foot gauge railways . 
Bond interest went unpaid in 1926 , and the town of <Location>Bridgton</Location> began a 15-year effort to preserve their railroad . 
The B&<Org>SR</Org> was reorganized as the <Person>Bridgton</Person> and <Person>Harrison</Person> ; but the extension to <Person>Harrison</Person> was dismantled after locomotive # 8 tipped over when the 35 # rails sagged in 1930 . 
Locomotive # 8 was the heaviest locomotive on any 2-foot gauge railway in <Location>Maine</Location> . 
B&<Org>SR</Org> became a tourist attraction as the last 2-foot gauge railroad offering passenger service in the late 1930 's . 
Operation ceased in September 1941 . 
The rolling stock was preserved when the rails were converted to scrap metal as the <Location>United States</Location> prepared for <Org>World</Org> War II . 
The rolling stock was moved to <Location>Massachusetts</Location> for another half-century of operation on the Edaville <Person>Railroad</Person> after the war .

The capture gun , also called a dart gun , is an invention which was refined by a team headed by Dr <Person>Tony Pooley</Person> and Dr <Person>Toni Harthoorn</Person> in <Location>Kenya</Location> in the early 1960 's . 
Since then it has become the standard tool for capture of large and medium-sized animals to transport them safely . 
The original piston-operated medium-bore gun fired a tranquilizer dart which is a syringe which was loaded with a dose of barbiturate and / or other drugs , backed by a ball bearing which was separated from the drug mix with a wadding . 
On impact with the animal the inertial momentum of the balls injects the drug into the animal , causing torpor and prostration within minutes . 
Because of the power of the drugs the handlers then have to move quickly to secure the animal for transport , monitor its vital signs , protect its eyes and ears , and then inject reversing drugs when needed . 
Many large animals are acutely sensitive to stress and can easily die without careful treatment . 
One major discovery by Dr <Person>Harthoorn</Person> 's team was that different species , despite being of roughly equal size ( for example the rhinoceros and the buffalo ) needed very different doses and spectra of drugs to safely immobilise them . 
In some species the margin of error is very small indeed . 
Modern capture guns are gas-fired and collapsible . 
Several models are available .

<Org>CBS</Org> Cable was an early cable network operated by <Org>CBS</Org> , Inc. , dedicated to the lively arts ( i.e. symphony , dance , theatre , opera , etc . ) . 
It debuted in October 1981 and ceased operations on December 17 , 1982 . 
<Org>CBS</Org> Cable was a personal project of <Org>CBS</Org> founder <Person>William Paley</Person> , who hoped it would blaze a trail for cultural programming in the then-emerging cable television medium . 
Its program offerings were ambitious and often critically praised . 
Nevertheless the network struggled , and ultimately failed , largely because of the reluctance of many cable systems across the <Location>United States</Location> to give it carriage , limiting severely its ability to attract both viewers and advertisers for its costly lineup of programming . 
Cable systems in the early 1980s had far more limited channel capacity than they do today ( usually only a few dozen channels in most cities ) . 
<Org>CBS</Org> Cable was competing for channel space by appealing to a select and relatively small upscale audience , while other networks coming on line at the same time such as <Org>MTV</Org> and <Org>ESPN</Org> promised larger and more broad-based viewership and therefore got cable operators to carry them far more easily . 
<Org>MTV</Org> and <Org>ESPN</Org> thrived and gave rise to additional companion channels within a short time , while the <Org>CBS</Org> Cable channel folded after just over 14 months in operation . 
Not to be confused with the CBS-operated cable network , Eye On People , which debuted in 1997 and soon turned into Discovery People , ultimately reorganized into <Org>Discovery Times</Org> .

Chamicuro is a critically endangered indigenous American language spoken by just a pair of aboriginal people in <Location>South America</Location> . 
The language is of the Chamicuro people who number between 10 and 20 . 
The Chamicuros live on a tributary of the Huallaga river , in PerУК , in an area called Pampa Hermosa , meaning beautiful plains . 
As with all native languages in PerУК , Chamicuro is by default an official language in the area in which it is spoken . 
A Chamicuro dictionary has been created , however no children can speak the language as they have shifted to Spanish . 
There is controversy in regard to whether Aguano is the same language , which one study ( Ruhlen 1987 ) says it is , but the Chamicuros dispute this ( <Person>Wise</Person> , 1987 ) , although this may be for cultural reasons and the languages may actually be intelligible but the different peoples do not relate to one another and maintain different names and connotations between their language or languages .

<Person>Christopher Bailey</Person> is a lecturer of English at the <Org>University of Brighton</Org> and is an occasional screenwriter for television . 
He wrote the script for the Doctor Who serial Kinda in 1982 . 
This script drew heavily on his own Buddhist faith and incorporated classic Buddhist terms such as dukkha , <Person>panna</Person> , <Person>karuna</Person> , devaloka and <Person>Mara</Person> --- indeed , " the <Person>Mara</Person> " was the name of the villain of the piece . 
The strength of his script led to <Person>Bailey</Person> writing a second story for Doctor Who in 1983 . 
This serial , Snakedance , was a sequel to Kinda . 
New script editor <Person>Eric Saward</Person> requested that <Person>Bailey</Person> devise another story idea , but neither the submitted outlines for May Time ( later renamed Manwatch ) nor The Children of <Person>Seth</Person> were taken further . 
As a result , the two <Person>Mara</Person> scripts were <Person>Bailey</Person> 's final broadcast work for both Doctor Who and television in general and he returned to a career in academia . 
<Person>Christopher Penley</Person> ( born circa 1990 --- January 15 2006 ) was a 15-year-old <Location>U.S.</Location> schoolboy who was shot by a SWAT team on January 13 , 2006 --- and died of his injuries --- after he had briefly taken another student hostage in a classroom and then later holed himself up in an outdoor bathroom at <Org>Milwee Middle School</Org> in <Location>Longwood</Location> , <Location>Florida</Location> , with an Airsoft gun painted entirely black to disguise it as a Beretta 9mm . 
After the gun was discovered by a fellow student , he forced the student into the closet and shut off the lights in the classroom . 
The student immediately fled and informed security , who called the police . 
SWAT arrived on the scene shortly thereafter , while a negotiator attempted to initiate contact with <Location>Penley</Location> . 
After a twenty minute stand-off he aimed the pistol at Lieutenant <Person>Michael Weippert</Person> , who responded by opening fire . 
He was transported to <Org>Orlando Regional Medical Center</Org> where he remained on life support for two days before succumbing to his wounds . 
A number of his organs were removed and used as transplants . 
<Location>Seminole County</Location> Sheriff <Person>Don Eslinger</Person> said the boy was suicidal and would not respond to negotiators who tried to talk him down in the bathroom . 
Some students at the school told the media after the incident that they knew he had " something planned " . 
<Org>Police</Org> have been criticized for initiating action instead of waiting for <Location>Penley</Location> 's father to arrive so that his father might talk him out of the situation . 
The <Location>Orlando</Location> Sentinel reported that <Person>Ralph Penley</Person> was not told of events until after his son was shot . 
The <Org>Florida Department of Law Enforcement</Org> investigated the shooting and found it entirely justified , as <Location>Penley</Location> pointed a weapon at the deputy . 
<Person>Christopher Penley</Person> 's organs were donated by his family . 
<Person>Chris Penley</Person> 's death gave 9 people vital organs . 
<Person>Christopher Penley</Person> has also had a game room at the <Org>Landmark Church</Org> dedicated to him and a Youth center .

<Location>Circuit Park</Location> <Org>Zandvoort</Org> is a motorsport race track located in the dunes near the town of <Location>Zandvoort</Location> , in <Location>the Netherlands</Location> , near the <Location>North Sea</Location> coast line . 
Although there were plans for races at <Org>Zandvoort</Org> before <Org>World</Org> War II , the first street race was held on June 3 , 1939 . 
A real circuit was not built until after the war , mainly designed by <Person>John Hugenholtz</Person> . 
The circuit was inaugurated on August , 7 , 1948 . 
Next year , in 1949 the circuit hosted the <Org>Zandvoort</Org> <Org>Grand</Org> Prix . 
It remained on the F1 calendar for 30 out of the next 34 years . 
The company that commercially ran the circuit ( CENAV ) went out of business , marking the end of Circuit <Org>Zandvoort</Org> . 
The track , owned by the municipality of <Org>Zandvoort</Org> , was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to Vendorado , a Bungalow park developer at that time . 
A plan to save the remaining track was made by a group of people and companies . 
In 1995 , CPZ got the " A Status " of the Dutch government and began building an international <Org>Grand Prix Circuit</Org> . 
One of the major events that is currently held at the circuit , along with DTM and A1GP , is the <Org>BP</Org> Ultimate Masters of Formula 3 , where Formula 3 cars of several national racing series compete with each other ( originally called Marlboro Masters , before tobacco advertising ban ) . 
The most famous corner in the circuit is the Tarzanbocht ( Tarzan corner ) which provides excellent overtaking opportunities . 
This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of Tarzan and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track 's designers named a nearby corner after him . 
On the other hand , many different stories about Tarzan Corner are known . 
<Location>Circuit Park</Location> <Org>Zandvoort</Org> played host to the first race in the 2006/07 season of A1 <Org>Grand</Org> Prix from 29 September - 1 October 2006 . 
In the history of the circuit , several fatal accidents have occurred . 
The older ' Classic ' <Org>Zandvoort circuit</Org> layout from 1967 is modeled in detail and can be driven in the <Org>Grand</Org> Prix Legends racing simulation for X86-based pc's . 
This was later converted to <Org>NASCAR</Org> 4 , <Org>NASCAR</Org> 2002 , 2003 and other simulations using a converter from website ' The Pits ' . 
The current layout is used in the SimBin game RACE 07 - <Person>Official</Person> WTCC <Org>Game</Org> .

The <Org>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</Org> ( <Org>CSHL</Org> ) is a private , non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer , neurobiology , plant genetics , genomics and bioinformatics . 
The Laboratory has a broad educational mission , including the recently established <Org>Watson School of Biological Sciences</Org> . 
Seven Nobel laureates have been associated with the lab . 
Though the lab 's name and address reference the town " <Org>Cold</Org> <Location>Spring Harbor</Location> " located in <Location>Suffolk</Location> County , <Location>Long Island</Location> , <Location>New York</Location> , its headquarters are in fact physically located in the adjacent <Location>Nassau County</Location> village of <Location>Laurel</Location> Hollow .. 
The laboratory began its history in 1890 as an extension of the <Org>Brooklyn Institute of Arts</Org> and Sciences ; in 1904 , the <Org>Carnegie</Org> Institution of <Location>Washington</Location> established the Station for Experimental Evolution at <Org>Cold</Org> <Location>Spring Harbor</Location> on the site . 
In 1921 , the station was reorganized as the <Org>Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics</Org> . 
The <Org>Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics</Org> scientists at <Org>Cold</Org> <Location>Spring Harbor</Location> made innumerable contributions to the sciences of genetics , medicine , and the then-infant science of molecular biology , and in 1962 its facilities merged with those of The <Org>Brooklyn Institute</Org> 's <Org>Biological Laboratory</Org> to create what is known today as <Org>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</Org> . 
In 1944 <Person>Barbara McClintock</Person> discovered at <Org>CSHL</Org> transposons ( " jumping genes " ) , for which she received the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . 
One well-known aspect of the Laboratory is its hosting of the experiments of <Person>Alfred Hershey</Person> and <Person>Martha Chase</Person> , and the work of <Person>Max DelbrУМc</Person> and Salvado <Person>Luria</Person> . 
Another Nobel laureate scientist there was <Person>Richard J. Roberts</Person> . 
Nobel laureate <Person>James D. Watson</Person> ( who co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA with Francis <Location>Crick</Location> ) served as the Laboratory 's Director and President for 35 years , and later assumed the role of Chancellor . 
In October 2007 <Person>Watson</Person> resigned as a result of controversial remarks about race made to The Sunday Times in the U.K . 
Currently , cancer biologist <Person>Bruce Stillman</Person> serves as laboratory President . 
During the years 1910 to 1940 , the laboratory was also the home of the <Org>Eugenics Record Office</Org> of biologist <Person>Charles B. Davenport</Person> and his assistant <Person>Harry H. Laughlin</Person> , two prominent American eugenicists of the period . 
In 1935 the <Org>Carnegie</Org> Institution sent a team to review their work , and as a result the <Org>ERO</Org> was ordered to stop all efforts . 
In 1939 the Institute withdrew funding for the <Org>ERO</Org> entirely , leading to its closure . 
Their reports , articles , charts , and pedigrees were considered scientific " facts " in their day , but have since been discredited . 
However , this closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ( Immigration Act of 1924 ) , which severely reduced the number of immigrants to <Location>America</Location> from southern and <Location>eastern Europe</Location> who , <Person>Harry Laughlin</Person> testified , were racially inferior than the Nordic immigrants from <Location>England</Location> and <Location>Germany</Location> . 
Aside from its scientific mission , the laboratory is host to world-class scientific conferences on a variety of topics . 
The first of the annual <Org>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</Org> Symposium on Quantitative Biology was held in 1934 . 
The Symposium in 1960 , <Org>Biological</Org> Clocks , was arguably the founding moment of the field of chronobiology . 
Now , over 24 meetings , in addition to the Symposium , for between 200 and 500 scientists , are held annually . 
The <Org>Banbury Center</Org> is a small conference center that holds discussion-style meetings for only 36 invited participants . 
These elite meetings cover often controversial topics in molecular biology and neuroscience . 
<Person>Salvador Luria</Person> and <Person>Max DelbrУМc</Person> founded the Phage Course in 1948 , a course that trained many of the leaders of the new field of molecular genetics . 
The courses proliferated under <Person>Watson</Person> 's guidance and each year some 28 advanced courses are held for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who travel to <Org>CSHL</Org> from throughout the world . 
The laboratory also offers many programs for students in high school and college in biotechnology and biology . 
The lab is particularly well known for its contributions towards the training of young scientists , notably through the establishment of its Undergraduate Research Program in 1959 , its <Org>Dolan DNA Learning Center</Org> in 1988 , and the founding of the <Org>Watson School of Biological Sciences</Org> in 1998 .

<Location>Connecticut</Location> Classic Lotto is one of the games offered by the <Location>Connecticut</Location> Lottery . 
It is drawn twice a week , on Tuesdays and Fridays . 
The earliest version of the game began in 1983 as a pick-6-of-36 . 
Later it became a 6/40 game . 
The current 6/44 matrix was adopted in September 1989 . 
The in-state game underwent further changes , such as adding a cash option in 1997 , and switching to what proved to be an unpopular " wild card " version in 1998 . 
The name was changed to " Classic Lotto " , and the wild card ball disappeared , in May 1999 . 
The current game ( as of 2007 ) pays winners $2 for matching three numbers , with parimutuel prizes for matching more numbers . 
The jackpot is won if all six match . 
Top-prize winners choose lump sum or annuity within 60 days of claiming the jackpot . 
In the unlikely event that the annuity is chosen , the prize is paid in 21 yearly installments . 
The overall prize pool is 52% of sales , half of which goes toward the jackpot alone . 
As with all <Location>Connecticut</Location> Lottery games , the minimum age to play Classic Lotto is 18 . 
The Classic Lotto jackpot was most recently hit on June 8 , 2007 ; the jackpot is almost never shared by two or more tickets . 
Winners of Classic Lotto ( jackpot or otherwise ) have one year to claim their prizes . 
A Classic Lotto jackpot of $3.5 million ( annuity ) on a ticket bought in February 2006 went unclaimed . 
The <Location>Connecticut</Location> Lottery had several options for distributing the $2.1 million cash that would have funded the jackpot prize ; as of June 2007 , there has been no official word as to what the money will be used for . 
It is possible the money will go into future Classic Lotto drawings ; for a time in the mid-to-late 1990s , unclaimed jackpot cash was used to guarantee starting jackpots of $2 million , instead of the usual $1 million . 
Since <Location>Connecticut</Location> is a member of the <Org>Multi-State Lottery Association</Org> ( MUSL ) , it is eligible to offer its other multi-state games . 
One of these is the annuitized jackpot game Hot Lotto , played the same as its flagship game Powerball ; however , <Location>Connecticut</Location> is planning to continue Classic Lotto into at least 2009 .

His research group at the university of <Location>Pittsburgh</Location> uses stress to trap excitons in confined regions , similar to the way atoms are confined in traps for Bose-Einstein condensation experiments . 
His book , A Biblical Case for an Old <Person>Earth</Person> was described in a review by Law Professor <Person>David W. Opderbeck</Person> , in the American Scientific Affiliation 's Perspectives on Science and <Person>Christian Faith</Person> as " succeed[ing ] admirably " in " establish[ing ] that the ' day-age ' view is a valid alternative for Christians who hold to biblical inerrancy " , but as " less persuasive " at " argu[ing ] for a concordist understanding of the <Org>Genesis</Org> texts and modern science .

<Person>Behe</Person> has stated that the results of the paper support his notion of irreducible complexity , based on the calculation of the probability of mutations required for evolution to succeed . 
<Person>Michael Lynch</Person> authored a response , to which <Person>Behe</Person> and <Person>Snoke</Person> responded . 
Protein Science discussed the papers in an editorial . 
On May 7 , 2005 , <Person>Behe</Person> described the paper in presenting arguments for irreducible complexity in his testimony at the <Location>Kansas</Location> evolution hearings . 
At the Kitzmiller v. <Org>Dover Area School</Org> District trial later that year it was the one article referenced by both <Person>Behe</Person> and <Person>Scott Minnich</Person> as supporting intelligent design . 
In his ruling , Judge <Person>Jones</Person> noted that " A review of the article indicates that it does not mention either irreducible complexity or ID . 
In fact , Professor <Person>Behe</Person> admitted that the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were used . "

<Person>Diego Silang</Person> y Andaya ( December 16 , 1730 - May 28 , 1763 ) was raised as an Ilocano ; his father was Pangasinense . 
He was a revolutionary leader who conspired with British forces to overthrow the Spanish in the <Location>northern Philippines</Location> and establish an independent Ilocano nation . 
His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish tributes and abuses , and his belief in self-government , that the administration and leadership of the <Org>Roman Catholic Church</Org> and government in the Ilocos Region ( which at this time did not include Pangasinan ) should be led by trained Ilocano officials . 
Born in Aringay , Pangasinan ( an area in present-day Caba or Aringay , <Org>La Union</Org> ) , he worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in Vigan , Ilocos Sur . 
Bright , passionate and fluent in Spanish , he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to <Location>Manila</Location> , journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seeds of rebellion . 
<Location>Spain</Location> allied with <Location>France</Location> during the Seven Years ' War against <Location>Great Britain</Location> . 
In so doing , the British sought to diminish the Spanish <Person>Empire</Person> . 
British naval forces took over <Location>Manila</Location> in October 1762 , that inspired uprisings in the farthest north of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan , where anti-Spanish sentiments festered . 
While <Person>Silang</Person> initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the Ilocos with native officials , and volunteered to head Ilocano forces against the British , desperate Spanish administrators transferred their powers to the <Org>Catholic</Org> Bishop of Nueva Segovia ( Vigan ) who in turn rejected <Person>Silang</Person> 's call . 
<Person>Silang</Person> 's group attacked the city and imprisoned its priests . 
He then began an association with the British who appointed him governor of the Ilocos on their behalf and promised him military reinforcement . 
The British force never materialized . 
He was killed by one of his friends , a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named <Person>Miguel Vicos</Person> who was paid by church authorities to assassinate him . 
After <Person>Diego Silang</Person> 's death , his wife , <Person>Josefa Gabriela</Person> , took over the revolt and fought courageously . 
A strong force was sent against her . 
She was forced to retreat to Abra . 
Riding a fast horse , <Person>Gabriela</Person> led her troops towards Vigan , but she was driven back . 
She fled again to Abra , where she was captured . 
On September 20 , 1763 , she and about 100 followers were executed by the Spanish authorities .

Digilogue is a music album of recordings which became the twentieth commercial release by the British avant-garde music group : zoviet*<Location>france</Location> : . 
It was first released in 1996 in limited edition 12 inch clear vinyl album format by the <Location>US</Location> record label , Soleilmoon Recordings . 
Subsequently , a <Org>CD</Org> version was released in 1998 by Soleilmoon Recordings , with additional tracks . 
The album 's title is an amalgamation of the words ' digital ' and ' analogue ' , two of the principal technologies that have been used in sound recording . 
The group have been quoted as adopting the failings in these technologies as a production technique in the creation of the album : " All audio equipment distorts sound to some degree and , eventually through mechanical and electrical failure , fucks it up . 
Since indeterminacy as a compositional parameter has been a constant in our work , this often produces what we regard as interesting new developments . 
digilogue was recorded using a mixture of failing analogue equipment and high-end digital equipment , and monitored in our studio exclusively on damaged hi-fi speakers . 
<Location>Sound</Location> can be as dirty and as clumsy as anything else we perceive with our senses . 
This is just as true of sound generated in the digital domain , much as we would all like to believe the claims of near-perfection made by audio equipment manufacturers . "

The island of <Location>Divar</Location> ( Divar-derived from the word Dipavati or ' small Island ' in Konkani ) lies in the state of <Location>Goa</Location> , <Location>India</Location> . 
It is located approximately 10 km from <Location>Panaji</Location> ( Panjim ) , and is approachable by ferry . 
The Island is connected to Old <Location>Goa</Location> on the south-east side , Ribandar , on the south-west side and Narve on the north side , all by ferry . 
A launch also connects <Location>Divar</Location> to the city of <Location>Panaji</Location> from further north-west , in the village of <Location>Vanxim</Location> . 
The Konkan <Person>Railway</Person> passes through the village and the nearest stop to the village is the train station at Karmali . 
The drive to the village is scenic , with <Person>paddy</Person> fields and wooded hills lacing the roadway , very typical of the Goan countryside . 
Though in a manner equally typical of modern <Location>Goa</Location> , of late the <Person>paddy</Person> fields lie fallow and overrun with weeds . 
The Island of <Location>Divar</Location> was a famous site of Hindu pilgrimage and hosted the the ancient temples of Shree Saptakoteshwar , Shree Ganesh and Shree Dwarkeshwar besides others . 
These were irreversibly destroyed by Portuguese zealots in the 16th century in their drive for Christianisation of <Location>Goa</Location> . 
The ancient site of Hindu pilgrimage is called Porne Tirth ( Old pilgrim spot-in Konkani ) even today . 
Rui Gomez <Location>Pereira</Location> in his book Goan temples and deities writes , " The original temple ( Of Shree Saptakoteshwar ) was constructed in the 12th century by the kings of Kadamba dynasty . 
Shree Saptakoteshwar was the patron Deity of the Kadambas . 
It was destroyed by the sultan of the Deccan in the middle of the 14th century and reconstructed at the same locality by Madhav Mantri of Vijaynagar at the close of the same century . 
It was again destroyed by the Portuguese in 1540 . " 
The Saptakoteshwar idol was shifted to Narve in Bicholim after the destruction of the temple by the Portuguese . 
The present temple in Narve , Bicholim was rebuilt by ShivajiRaje Bhonsale the Great Maratha leader . 
A Jesuit priest Fr <Person>Francisco Sousa</Person> documented the religious importance of " <Location>Divar</Location> " in his book Oriente Conquistado ( Conquest of the orient ) around the latter quarter of the 16th or early 17th century . 
Fr. <Person>Sousa</Person> testifies that " <Location>Divar</Location> was as much venerated by the Hindu Brahmins as the Holy land by us , on account of a temple of many indulgences and pilgrimages. .. " Rui Gomez <Location>Pereira</Location> details further stating , " The linga of the temple , made of five metals - gold , silver , copper , iron and bronze " was later relocated in Bicholim . 
And on the foundations of the same temple a prayer and catechism house was constructed in 1563 , which was later transformed into the chapel of Our Lady of Cande laria . " 
The original inhabitants of this island were people who once lived in Old <Location>Goa</Location> but had to desert during a disastrous pest that greatly reduced the population of Old <Location>Goa</Location> . 
Piedade , a small village is spread at the bottom of a small forested hillock on which there is the <Org>Church of Our Lady</Org> of Compassion . 
The island is dotted with well maintained , elegant Portuguese villas . 
From the top of the hill , superb panoramic views of the surrounding countryside , including Old <Location>Goa</Location> , the capital of <Location>Goa</Location> , <Location>Panaji</Location> , the meandering Mandovi river , and the bridges across it can be seen . 
The famous Bonderam festival is celebrated in <Location>Divar</Location> on the fourth Saturday of August during the monsoon with great fanfare and attended by thousands of tourists and locals . 
Bonderam Festival : The festival is a memoir to the dispute and the fury of the Villagers over the Portuguese system of resolving the disputes . 
The villagers on the <Location>Divar Island</Location> often indulged in some kind of fight over the matter of ownership of their lands . 
To stop the disputes the Portuguese , put up flags at the boundaries . 
The villagers did not like this system . 
So they protested against the Portuguese by throwing stones at the flags . 
On this day a carnival ambience is created . 
Each section of the village has a float at the parade . 
Melodious music could be heard throughout the village . 
The gaily colored floats accompanied by colorfully dressed youngsters make a pretty picture . 
The huge bell which today adorns the <Org>Se Cathedral</Org> in Old <Location>Goa</Location> was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who 'd made a vow that , were he to survive his fate , he would donate the ship 's bell to the first church village , town , or city his vessel touched . 
It so happened that that island was <Location>Divar</Location> . 
In keeping with his promise , he donated the bell to the church of <Location>Divar</Location> , which is located on a high hillock . 
Unfortunately though , every time the bell was struck , it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity , so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with that of the <Org>Se Cathedral</Org> . 
<Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> ( nУЉe Brende <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> ) ( October 24 1764 - August 3 1839 ) was a German novelist and translator . 
<Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> was born in 1764 in <Location>Berlin</Location> [1 ] . 
Oldest daughter of the philosopher <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> , a leading figure in the German Enlightenment ( Aufklarung ) . 
She married the merchant and banker <Person>Simon Veit</Person> in 1783 . 
Their son , Philipp <Person>Veit</Person> , would later become part of a circle of German Christian painters called " the Nazarenes , " who influenced the later English painters in the <Org>Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</Org> . 
She met the poet and critic <Person>Friedrich von Schlegel</Person> in the salon of her friend Henriette Herz , after which she left her husband . 
They were divorced in 1799 . 
She obtained custody of her younger son , <Person>Phillip</Person> , and lived with him at the ZiegelstraУe , which became a salon frequented by Tieck , Schelling , the <Person>Schlegel</Person> brothers , and Novalis . 
<Person>Schlegel</Person> 's novel " <Person>Lucinde</Person> " ( 1799 ) was seen as an account of their affair , causing a scandal in German literary circles . 
In 1801 her novel " Florentin " was published anonymously by <Person>Schlegel</Person> . 
They lived in <Location>Paris</Location> from 1802 until 1804 , and after her divorce they married as <Org>Protestants</Org> . 
In 1807lt she translated " <Person>Corinne</Person> " by <Person>Madame de StaУЋ</Person> from the French . 
In 1808 , <Person>Friedrich</Person> and <Person>Dorothea</Person> converted to Catholicism . 
( She may have adopted the name " <Person>Dorothea</Person> " from a 17th century <Person>Dorothea von Schlegel</Person> who composed <Org>Catholic</Org> hymns ) . 
They continued to visit the salons of Rahel Levin and Henriette Herz , as well as the constellation which surrounded <Person>Madame de StaУЋ</Person> . 
<Person>Friedrich</Person> died in 1829 , after which she moved to <Location>Frankfurt</Location> am Main . 
There , she lived with her son Philipp ( also a convert to a medieval style of Catholicism ) until her death in 1839 . 
Since she was the daughter of the greatest Jewish philosopher of the Enlightenment - Moses <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> - ( of equal stature with <Person>Immanuel Kant</Person> , and translator of <Person>John Locke</Person> and <Person>Alexander Pope</Person> , as well as <Org>Hebrew</Org> scriptures into German ) , <Person>Dorothea</Person> was surrounded throughout her life by the leading poets , critics , musicians , novelists , and philosophers of <Location>Europe</Location> . 
Gotthold <Person>Ephraim Lessing</Person> was her father 's closest friend and colleague , and the Emancipation and secularization of the Jews and Jewish culture was a direct outcome of their work . 
( <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> was the model for <Person>Nathan der Weise</Person> in <Person>Lessing</Person> 's play of the same name . ) 
<Person>Friedrich</Person> the Great was <Person>Lessing</Person> 's patron , and he extended royal protection and sponsorship to <Person>Mendelssohn</Person> , as well . 
<Person>Dorothea</Person> 's brother , <Person>Joseph</Person> , was a friend and sponsor of <Person>Alexander von Humboldt</Person> , the great naturalist and ethnologist . 
Her nephew was <Person>Felix Mendelssohn</Person> , the composer , who with his sister , <Person>Fanny</Person> , were considered nearly the equals of the Mozarts as child prodigies . 
To fully appreciate the importance of this cultural scene , see the entries for <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> , Gotthold <Person>Ephraim Lessing</Person> , <Person>Friedrich Schlegel</Person> , Germaine de <Person>StaУЋ</Person> , <Person>Felix Mendelssohn</Person> , Ludwi Tieck , Novalis , and others . 
<Person>Dorothea</Person> was the common link or nexus among them all . 
Most of her work , letters , biographies , etc. seem to be available only in German . 
And there , with the legacy of the Holocaust , she would seem to have an ambiguous status . 
The emancipation of European Jewry , in which she and her family played the greatest imaginable role , became the main target of the Third Reich and its <Location>Nuremberg</Location> <Person>Laws</Person> . 
For some Jews , she may be a less than admirable figure as well , having left her Jewish husband , violated her divorce settlement , and converted first to Protestantism ( which was favorable towards Judaism ) , and finally to Catholicism ( which was not ) . 
Most of her later friends were Christians , assimilated or intermarried Jews ( like Rahel Levin ) , or secular Deists and materialists . 
Her association with Germaine de <Person>StaУЋ</Person> was obviously of the greatest importance , since she was also the patron and literary companion of <Person>Dorothea</Person> 's second husband , <Person>Friedrich Schlegel</Person> . 
De <Person>StaУЋ</Person> was the daughter of <Person>Jacques Necker</Person> , <Person>Louis</Person> XVI 's finance minister , and a leading figure in the collapse of the Bourbons and the French Revolution . 
( See <Person>Christopher Herrold</Person> 's " Mistress to an Age . " ) 
It was probably through de <Person>StaУЋ</Person> 's husband , a Swedish Count , that the <Person>Schlegel</Person> 's were granted a title of nobility in the Swedish court . 
[ 1 ] In older literature and on her gravestone one finds the date 1763 , but this is the birthyear of her older sister <Person>Sara</Person> ( May 23rd 1763-April 15 1764 ) whose untimely death was one of the reasons <Person>Moses Mendelssohn</Person> wrote the Phaedon .

<Person>Duane Bobick</Person> ( born 24 August , 1950 in Little Falls , <Location>Minnesota</Location> ) was a boxer from the <Location>United States</Location> , who became world amateur heavyweight champion in 1971 , and also won the gold medal at the 1971 <Org>Pan American</Org> Games . 
He fought for the <Location>United States</Location> at the 1972 <Person>Summer Olympics</Person> in <Location>Munich</Location> , <Location>West Germany</Location> , and later contended for the world heavyweight belt during the division 's most highly rated era . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> 's younger brother <Person>Rodney Bobick</Person> was also a heavyweight boxer , though less successful , and died in a single car crash in 1977 . 
Six foot , three inches tall and 215 pounds in his prime , <Person>Bobick</Person> was part of a boxing family and grew up with the sport in the 1960s . 
A tremendous puncher who developed well early by virtue of countless hours in the gym and ring , <Person>Bobick</Person> had an outstanding amateur career that included a win over <Location>Cuba</Location> 's famous TeУГfil Stevenson at the 197 <Org>Pan American</Org> Games . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> added another future champion to his list when he beat <Person>Larry Holmes</Person> to be named to the 1972 <Location>U.S.</Location> Olympic boxing team for the <Location>Munich</Location> Olympics . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was rated a star at this early stage , and may have been very overconfident as he met Stevenson again during the Olympic trials . 
Despite <Person>Bobick</Person> winning the second round , Stevenson knocked <Person>Bobick</Person> down in the third and the contest was stopped . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> trained hard to start his pro career , which did not begin until the following spring , 1973 . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> trained with and was managed by heavyweight legend <Person>Joe Frazier</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> 's first match was against <Person>Tommy Burns</Person> . 
He sent <Person>Burns</Person> to the canvas four times on his way to a first-round <Person>KO</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> had 14 other fights in 1973 , winning them all by <Person>KO</Person> , including a win over former contender <Person>Manuel Ramos</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> won his first 19 fights by knockout . 
He had 10 more fights in 1974 , winning them all again , eight by <Person>KO</Person> . 
Knockout wins that year included <Person>Ted Gullick</Person> and future champion <Person>Mike Weaver</Person> . 
He also decisioned veteran boxer <Person>Billy Daniels</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was now 25-0 with 23 KOs . 
He was then rated by many to be the sport 's new " <Org>White</Org> <Location>Hope</Location> , " taking that label from then-declining <Person>Jerry Quarry</Person> . 
<Person>Frazier</Person> himself was approaching retirement and focusing on upcoming paydays with protege <Person>Bobick</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> gained top-10 ranking in 1975 with eight more fights and wins , all again by <Person>KO</Person> . 
He was now being dodged by some , but a win over <Person>Randy Neumann</Person> proved he could not be ignored . 
He had a tentative contract with <Person>Muhammed Ali</Person> in 1976 , but the fight never materialized . 
Instead he met and defeated <Person>Larry Middleton</Person> , fellow Minnesotan <Person>Scott LeDoux</Person> , <Person>Bunny Johnson</Person> and <Person>Chuck Wepner</Person> among his five 1976 fights , all wins with two KOs . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> had now improved enough as a boxer to be a legitimate title threat . 
He took a 38-0 record with 34 <Person>KO</Person> 's into the ring against powerful former champion <Person>Ken Norton</Person> in May 1977 . 
The two punchers went right after each other . 
<Location>Norton</Location> connected first and very hard . 
Following up on the staggered <Person>Bobick</Person> , <Location>Norton</Location> also landed a hard punch to <Person>Bobick</Person> 's windpipe but was never penalized . 
The fight lasted just one minute before <Person>Bobick</Person> was counted out . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> was widely criticized after the <Org>Norton</Org> match and dismissed by many . 
Saturday Night Live made fun of <Person>Bobick</Person> by showing footage of his Nationally televised knockout loss , over and over again . 
Despite that , he was back in the ring two months later , winning a rematch with <Person>Scott LeDoux</Person> . 
He finished the year 1977 40-1 with 36 <Person>KO</Person>'s . 
In 1978 , he was upset by South African puncher <Person>Kallie Knoetze</Person> for his second <Person>KO</Person> loss . 
He fought eight more times against second-tier fighters in 1978 , winning all by <Person>KO</Person> . 
He was looking to return to top-level contention in 1979 when he was <Person>KO 'd</Person> by future beltholder <Person>John Tate</Person> . 
Another <Person>KO</Person> loss to <Person>George Chaplin</Person> that year led to an announcement of retirement . 
His pro record was 48-4 with 42 KOs with wins over several notable contenders . 
All four of his pro losses were by <Person>KO</Person> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> returned to <Location>Minnesota</Location> and took heavy industry work before a machine accident nearly killed him in 1997 . 
After that he went into coaching and public speaking , using his still-present celebrity to encourage and help others . 
In November 2006 , <Person>Bobick</Person> was elected as a city councilman for the <Location>City</Location> of Little Falls , <Location>Minnesota</Location> . 
<Person>Bobick</Person> also tried his hand at acting as , naturally , a boxer in <Person>Billy</Person> boy in 1979 . 
His brother <Person>Rodney</Person> also was a professional boxer with a 37-7 record .

<Person>Eduard Hitzig</Person> ( February 6 , 1839 - August 20 , 1907 ) was a German neuropsychiatrist from <Location>Berlin</Location> . 
He studied medicine in <Location>Berlin</Location> and WУМrzburg . 
He had as instructors , famous men such as <Person>Emil Du Bois-Reymond</Person> ( 1818-1896 ) , <Person>Rudolf Virchow</Person> ( 1821-1902 ) , <Person>Moritz Heinrich Romberg</Person> ( 1795-1873 ) and <Person>Karl Friedrich Otto</Person> Westphal ( 1833-1890 ) . 
He received his doctorate in 1862 , and subsequently practiced medicine in <Location>Berlin</Location> and WУМrzburg . 
In 1875 he became director of the BurghУЖlzli asylum , as well as professor of psychiatry at the <Org>University of Zurich</Org> . 
In 1885 <Person>Hitzig</Person> became a professor at the <Org>University of Halle</Org> , where he remained until his retirement in 1903 . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> is remembered for his work concerning the interaction between electrical current and the brain . 
In 1870 , <Person>Hitzig</Person> assisted by anatomist <Person>Gustav Fritsch</Person> ( 1837-1927 ) , applied electricity via a thin probe to the exposed cerebral cortex of a dog without anesthesia . 
They performed these studies at the home of <Person>Fritsch</Person> because the <Org>University of Berlin</Org> would not allow such experimentation in their laboratories . 
What <Person>Hitzig</Person> and <Person>Fritsch</Person> had discovered is that electrical stimulation of different areas of the cerebrum caused involuntary muscular contractions of specific parts of the dog 's body . 
They identified the brains ' " motor strip " which is a vertical strip of brain tissue on the cerebrum in the back of the frontal lobe which controls different muscles in the body . 
In 1870 <Person>Hitzig</Person> published his findings in an essay called " On the Electrical Excitability of the Cerebrum " . This experimentation was considered the first time anyone had done any " localized study " regarding the brain and electrical current . 
However this was not the first time <Person>Hitzig</Person> had experienced the interaction between the brain and electricity ; earlier in his career as a physician working with the Prussian <Org>Army</Org> he experimented on wounded soldiers whose skulls were fractured by bullets . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> noticed that applying a small electrical current to the brains of these soldiers caused involuntary muscular movement . 
Apparently <Person>Hitzig</Person> 's crude experimentation was inspired by work of 18th century physicist <Person>Luigi Galvani</Person> who noticed this same electrical phenomena on the brains of frogs . 
<Person>Hitzig</Person> and <Person>Fritsch</Person> 's work opened the door to further " localized testing " of the brain by many others including Scottish neurologist , <Person>David Ferrier</Person> .

The field exploits horizontal drilling technology by perforating the productive rocks parallel to the beds , rather than through a vertical well perpendicular to the relatively thin Bakken Formation . 
At <Location>Elm</Location> Coulee <Location>Field</Location> , the Bakken is only about 45 feet thick and lies at depths of 8,500 to 10,500 feet , but horizontal wells penetrate 3,000 to 5,000 feet of the reservoir rock , a porous dolomite of Devonian age that probably originated as a large carbonate bank on the western flank of the basin . 
The field is a stratigraphic trap . 
In 2006 , <Location>Elm</Location> Coulee was producing about 53,000 barrels of oil per day from more than 350 wells . 
Ultimate production is expected to exceed 270,000,000 barrels , with some estimates as high as 500,000,000 barrels . 
Production at <Location>Elm</Location> Coulee has more than doubled the oil output of the state of <Location>Montana</Location> .

EZ2DJ cabinet features a total of 10 speakers . 
There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen , and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine . 
The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks , so that both players may use their own headphones to enjoy the game 's audio . 
Using headphones does not disable the external speakers . 
EZ2DJ cabinet features four red effector buttons , located at the top of the controller part . 
However , unlike the Beatmania series ( including III and IIDX ) , depending on the gamemode , effector button are treated as a gameplay button , especially in the gamemode " Radio Mix " , where each player need to control 2 effector buttons . 
Essentially this is very similar to the 7 key mode of beatmania IIDX , but due to the location of these effector button --- located in a row right at center of the console panel , right underneath the screen and away from the keyboard --- it makes it even more difficult than beatmania IIDX in some occasion ( especially since it also use the pedal ) . 
Also , another gamemode named " Space Mix " uses all four buttons along with all keys and turn tables ( excludes pedals ) , becoming the hardest gamemode in the game . 
The pedal is used in all gameplay and treated as a gameplay button . 
But , in Space Mix , it is used as speed adjustor . 
EZ2DJ 's passing system is known as the " survival gauge " ; one needs to keep the gauge above 0% until the end of song to pass , similar to systems used in many dance-simulation games .
